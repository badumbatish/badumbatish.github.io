<p>Hey everyone, how everyone's doing? I've graduated Berkeley and have been back at my parents' place for a while now,
getting
ready to start
Igalia :)
I'm still doing good hahhaa :)</p>
<p>I always thought getting back to OC after being far far away in Berkeley wonderland means that everything's gonna
change for me: I won't have to do homework anymore :) I'll go to bed early blabla bla; But here I am writing this
blog at 2 AM hahhaha. I realized that changing the environment doesn't necessarily change me personally; I'd need
to change myself on my own :) Being next to my family makes me really grateful, but now I'm starting to miss my
high school teacher as well as my nanny in Viet Nam. I really wanna go back soon :)</p>
<p>Anyways, let's talk business hahah :)
This article documents what I've learned about the basics of LLVM's code generation process, self-contained in
lowering from AST to LLVM-IR. This includes basic stack variables, addition, subtraction, etc etc to strings, structs
as well as garbage collection.</p>
<p>As is tradition, here are three songs for you by Zedd: <a href="https://youtu.be/HwtljkGZJnI?si=6kS1eXfN3DS7TokP" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Papercut</a>,
<a href="https://youtu.be/ZqJiXLJs_Pg?si=P8as3-nXevZ3BfuA" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Addicted To A Memory</a>, and
<a href="https://youtu.be/BjsjIkSb0cM?si=rNyI9JeS6N5r1NFc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Done With Love</a>. All
three songs showcase extremely well the emotional depth of a person in and out of love.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the songs (and the blog post as well!) :)</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Codegen in LLVM is an extremely well-thought-out process. For a simple stack-centric codegen
process, the framework
users
can abstract away SSA form; the <strong>alloca</strong> process together with mem2reg allows an
extremely fast assembly generation even for primitive stack allocations.</p>
<p>In this article, I'll report on the codegen process of sammine-lang, an extension on the kaleidoscope tutorial.
Besides code generation for scalar values, funcitons and control flow, the article also touches on code gen for
aggregated data types such as structs :) I hope everyone enjoys :)</p>
<p>The below picture demonstrates sammine's ability to generate code for fibonacci, a classic mathematical problem :)
[TODO: show that sammine can indeed code fibonacci and output assembly for it]</p>
<p>Aggregated datatype's also generated with sammine:

<p>Back in Berk, I sometimes would play <a href="https://www.factorio.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Factorio</a> in my free time. The game is intuitive
and interesting. But for some
reasons, the game really stresses me out. "Wait a minute, I love problem-solving, don't I? But I feel so stressed
trying to build the factory with these new science packs and these new different energy types." Now, in this summer
of 2025, when I'm writing my own compiler, I suddenly realize the reason. I love problem sovling, but I was solving
the wrong problems. I wasn't interested in trying to build and maintain factories. Rather, compiler always seems to have
a softer spot in my heart. That and blog writing, hence I'm writing this :)</p>
<p>Ah, I still don't know what I'm rambling
about. I guess what I'm trying to say is in that in my experience, while I enjoy problem-solving in general, it also
matters what type of problems I'm solving. Factorio, leaning hard into resource management and logistics, just isn't
my forte, which is creative expression (writing), coding and abstraction (compiler engineer). Maybe front-end
and/or back-end
development
isn't what you love,
then you
should consider switching to compiler engineering, ahhahahha :P</p>
<p>Anyways, let's now talk about the
lowering of printing..</p>
<p>Right now, in sammine, I'm adopting a python-esque way of printing:</p>

<p>With int and double powered by alloca, how should we go around lowering this?</p>

<p>I also want to extend my thanks to all the developers that helped contributed to the

keep track of my bagels :)</p>
<p><img src="/blogs/bagel_count/bagel_origin.png" alt="bagel_origin">
17:
It's been a while since I've written one of these. This one is with Dee. Ahead of our trip to San Diego, we went to this bagel shop
around 8, and I got
this sausage, egg and cheese bagel :) I don't quite remember what she got hahha. I don't remember a lot of stuff. She said she's afraid I might
have dementia. Woops, hopefully I don't lose my memory too fast.</p>
<p>16:
Around June of this year, I've flown up to San Francisco to visit Emi again before she moves to Boston for her Master at Harvard.
I'm very proud of her :) This is just a plain bagel with cream cheese, eaten at her place :) But there's something homey and familiar that
I can't quite place my finger on. Must have been me missing my bestie when writing this :)</p>
<p>15:
A lot has changed since the last bagel. I signed my offer letter for Igalia, I finally got my US citizenship hehe,
my family's also coming up for the commencement, I'm really happy.
Ahhh it's truely a leap from #14 to #15 :) This bagel again is the good'ol Honey Almond Cream
Cheese
Bagel,
I got it while on my way to the citizenship interview.
Monday, May 19 2025.</p>
<p>13 and 14:
They say that by looking at somebody's bagel history, you can learn a lot about the person. Well, maybe it's only me that say that :)
#13 - honey almond cream cheese bagel and #14 - strawberry cream cheese bagel, and possibly all the bagels before this, speaks to how I'm a
creature of comfort :) Bagel street cafe is good and it's easy to order :) I like it for that. But I can't help but wonder once I get back
to Orange County, what will be my next bagel.</p>
<p>11 and 12:
This time I did two bagels with mozarella cheese and normal cream cheese. I was feeling really stressed out with
my cs174 grades being so bad and cs170 midterm exam happening today. If #10 talks about the contention between two
different flavors to be the dominating one then #11 and 12 disappointingly showcase why you don't do a slide of
cheese on top of the normal cream cheese: it nulls out the whole bagel (because nobody's competing to be the main
flavor)
and it makes the whole thing unmemorable.
I did try to carve out some bread in the two bagels out (per #7 and #8) and I think it really helps them taste less
full. Will try
again. My oven skill is not too good to have the bagels be crunchy yet but I'm improving it every day.
Emi is
still sick lol.
Thurs, Apr 3, 2025. 3/10 rating</p>
<p>10: Emi is sick today. And for some reason I wanted to go to Bagel Street Cafe for a bagel again. And then it's
time for
ding ding ding you guessed it, a red bull :) I've been trying to study more so I just buy a red bull every time
to reward (and trick) myself to study. It's a honey almond cream cheese with blueberry bagel this time. The flavor is a
bit weird
this time. When I bite into the bagel, it feels like the blueberry and the honey almond is fighting with each other
to see who gets to be the main dominating flavor. Wed, Apr 2, 2025. 5/10 rating</p>
<p>9: When on a walk/date with Lorem Ipsum , we got bagel at Bagel Street Cafe. I always come back to my familiar spots and
bagels' no different. This time its a "Poppy Seed Bagel Honey Almond Cream Cheese". 8/10 again. It's a solid
experience :) The poppy seed this time makes it interesting :) I'm glad i got Lorem to enjoy it with me. She was
really guiding the question since I had stayed up 2am yesterday and couldn't sleep much. I felt bad hahah.</p>
<p>7 and 8: I woke up at 9:30AM today after falling asleep at 8PM yesterday. I woke up, drank some non-redbull energy
drink and ate two basic cream cheese again at my place. I didn't put enough cream cheese again, I'm not sure why but
it always felt like there's more bread than there are cream cheese. Next time I'll hollow out the bagels a little
bit so I'm not chewing on so much bread. Sun march 16 2025. 5/10 this time hahaha, much improvement over the 4th and
5th
bagel.</p>
<p>6: with Emi and Noah at their place in SF :) A bagel with raisins and cream cheese, its really good :) I like
hanging out with them. Sat mar 15 2025. 8/10 hahah :)</p>
<p>4 and 5: at home cream cheese in anchor house haha :) just stuffing my place with bagels. I didn't put enough cream
cheese :( :( :(. I gotta rate myself 4 out of 10 for this.</p>
<p>3.With Julia and Sherry: A bagel with honey almond flavored cream cheese at Bagel street coffee. March 11 2025. I
like the sweetness, but couldn't taste any almond. 8.5/10, really good, no almod.</p>
<p>2: with Josh. A flavored cream cheese bagel: sun dried tomato. Bagel street caffe. Pretty good, not too sweet not
too salty, really nice. sat, march 8, 2025. 7/10, couldn't taste the sun dried tomato</p>
<p>1: with Emi and Noah at a shop near their place. Just a basic cream cheese. saturday. sat mar 1 2025. I rate this
out 10/10 just because it's the first time I tasted it, and it's with Emi and Noah.</p>15:T76fe,<nav class="toc"><ol class="toc-level toc-level-1"><li class="toc-item toc-item-h1"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h1" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h1"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h1" href="#pre-req">Pre-req</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h1"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h1" href="#overall-framework">Overall framework</a><ol class="toc-level toc-level-2"><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#lattices">Lattices</a><ol class="toc-level toc-level-3"><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#latticeanchor">LatticeAnchor</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#analysisstate">AnalysisState</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#abstractsparselattice--public-analysisstate">AbstractSparseLattice : public AnalysisState</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#executable--public-analysisstate-and-deadcodeanalysis">Executable : public AnalysisState and DeadcodeAnalysis</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#constantvalue-and-constantpropagationanalysis">ConstantValue and ConstantPropagationAnalysis</a></li></ol></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#forward-and-backward-analysis">Forward and backward analysis</a><ol class="toc-level toc-level-3"><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#dataflowsolver">DataflowSolver</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#sparseforwardanalysis-and-sparsebackwardanalysis">SparseForwardAnalysis and SparseBackwardAnalysis</a></li></ol></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#generic-iterative-analysis">Generic iterative analysis</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#demo">Demo</a></li></ol></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h1"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h1" href="#case-study-intrangeanalysis">Case study: IntRangeAnalysis</a></li></ol></nav><p>Hi everyone, how's everybody doing? Wow, it's almost the end of 2025 isn't it?
I started doing the blog in 2024 as a way to bla bla bla bla a lot of memories bla bla bla bla.</p>
<p>With each blog coming out every 2 or 3 months, I guess this is the end for 2025? Hahahhaha.</p>

<h1 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>Dataflow analysis is an important technique in compilers. Even with tons of resources on dataflow analysis, it is not always
easy to operate such technique in a concrete implementation(?! todo: redo this bruv, doesn't sound good).</p>
<p>Even though there has been a tutorial for it, as well a pull request to update it, I still want to add this article as a
report on what I've found out reading around in the dataflow codebase.</p>
<p>With LLVM featuring a more time-tested approach to tutorials, I also want to give this article a closer look and a more intrapersonal
read to it.</p>
<p>Happy reading everyone.</p>

<p>A lot of my reading and understanding is drawn from Engineering a Compiler, chapter 9 specifically. So when a text is
put between double quotes, or is quoted somehow, you can assume it is from said book.</p>
<p>You can find the book readily available for free on the internet. Here, I'll quote a few necessary snippets to remind readers.</p>

<li>Value: an SSA value.</li>
<li>GenericLatticeAnchor: Other cases that is not covered by ProgramPoint or Value, like a CFGEdge cases that is not covered
by ProgramPoint or Value, like a CFGEdge in  the case of dead code analysis. (TODO: also give a clearer why, not just say CFGEdge).
from the comments in the codebase: "In classical data-flow analysis,
lattice anchor represent positions in a program to which lattice elements
are attached."</li>
</ul>
<p>IMO, the LatticeAnchor class models something that can carry the lattice value. This is not to be confused with
the next class that we'll talk about, the AnalysisState class.</p>
<h3 id="analysisstate"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#analysisstate"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>AnalysisState</h3>
<p>Base class for generic analysis states. Analysis states contain data-flow
information that are attached to lattice anchors and which evolve as the
analysis iterates.</p>
<p>If LatticeAnchor talks about the class that can carry the lattice value, then the AnalysisState class represents the lattice value itself.</p>
<p>Since this is a base class, it doesn't inherently have a value that can represent a lattice. Rather, the class provides utilities
to</p>
<ul>
<li>which points in the program to notify the dataflow solver to further analyze if my state change (addDependency())</li>
<li>which point in the program am I representing? (getAnchor())</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="abstractsparselattice--public-analysisstate"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#abstractsparselattice--public-analysisstate"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>AbstractSparseLattice : public AnalysisState</h3>
<p>AbstractSparseLattice specializes in representing lattice state for SSA values.
Here, we start seeing more distinct shape of a lattice state, with functions like join() and meet().</p>
<p>A fun fact is both SparseForwardAnalysis (SFA) and SparseBackwardAnalysis (SBA) requires the lattice class to subclass AbstractSparseLattice .</p>
<p>to subclass AbstractSparseLattice, users just have to implement the printing method and depending on if the lattice will
be use in a forward or backward style, implement join() or meet()</p>
<h3 id="executable--public-analysisstate-and-deadcodeanalysis"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#executable--public-analysisstate-and-deadcodeanalysis"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Executable : public AnalysisState and DeadcodeAnalysis</h3>
<p>The Executable class is a very important class in the dataflow framework in MLIR. The class represents if a code is dead or not.
Normally, it is not helpful to talk about every single class that subclasses AnalysisState; this blog would be too long then.
But since both SFA and SBA requires the Executable lattice state and by default, the
Executable lattice state is false, if you fail to load the deadcode analysis before loading your own analysis when basing your
analysis off of SFA or SBA, no analysis will be done.</p>
<p>The loading of deadcode analysis can be done as follows:</p>

<p>If the opening paragraph of the Executable class discusses how SFA and SBA relies on DeadCodeAnalysis, the following section talks about how
DeadCodeAnalysis itself relies on ConstantPropagationAnalysis to function in the context of control flow.</p>
<p>If we havne't load the solver with the ConstantPropagationAnalysis pass, in the function visitBranchOperation, when we encounter
getOperandValues, operands will always be nullopt, leading to the edges uninitialized, which is automatically assumed as false.</p>

<p>With the large number of dialects that MLIR has, a person should better stay within the framework of the dataflow analysis to
ensure the minimal time to set up and less debugging headache :)</p>
<p>The dataflow framework introduces two kind of dataflow analysis that users can inherit from, forward and backward,
each inheriting from SparseForwardAnalysis and SparseBackwardAnalysis. One
thing interesting to note is that DeadCodeAnalysis itself inherit directly from DataFlowAnalysis. While this is possible,
I want to note that it's not advisable and should only be done if you're looking for some kind of specialized flavor of dataflow analysis.</p>

<p>The blog highlights my short survey on ClangIR and attempts to show readers the vision that maybe one day ClangIR will replace the OG Clang system in terms
of analysis :) The work of surveying, implementing and writing up the blog is about 4 weeks.
At the time of writing, I was implementing fall-through only.</p>
<p>As promise, here is a song for everyone: <a href="https://youtu.be/Fq_8g1uotgA?si=_4z_WckmJVo1pC8M" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Blackbox</a> by COIN.</p>
<h2 id="old-fall-through-algorithm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#old-fall-through-algorithm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Old fall through algorithm</h2>
<p>To understand the old fallthrough algorithm we should talk a bit about the CFG. The ClangCFG is a pretty primitive CFG where we have statements in a raw basic block and each block connects with each other via a branch or jump. A basic block in ClangCFG is raw in the sense that it can only contain other statements (operations) and no statements (operations) or blocks can contain it. This means that upon
visiting a statement that we care about, we fail to intrinsically have any context over where the statement is in. For example, if we encounter a return statement, we'd like to know if the return is within a switch statement or is it a top level return of a function so as to determine if there is any control flow escaping the switch or not.</p>
<p>In the old algorithm, we take a function as input and get all the reachable blocks of said function, and then the algorithm iterates over each statement in each reachable blocks and check off global variables that determine fall through. This presents a few drawbacks: the algorithm is hard to debug since the majority of decisions are made with a few global variables.</p>

<h2 id="new-algorithm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#new-algorithm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>New algorithm</h2>
<p>The new algorithm relies on the ClangIR instead of the traditional CFG. In ClangIR, a block is usually associated with an operation. Moreover, block are usually nested together to form the ClangIR CFG instead of the OG ClangCFG's block-by-block linking style.</p>
<p>The change in the structure means that the new algorithm will be more effective at detecting fall through as well as easier to maintain. The effective comes from being able to deduce context where an operation resides and the ease of maintain came from the modularity and the recursive nature that the new algorithm offers.</p>
<p>In the new algorithm, a function (CIR_FuncOp) is fallthrough-able if one of its block (mlir::Block) is fallthrough-able.</p>
<p>A block is fallthrough-able if one of its operations inside it is fallthrough-able.</p>
<p>An operation (CIR operations that inherit from mlir::Operation) is fallthrough-able if</p>
<ul>
<li>through special handling, it is fallthrough-able.</li>
<li>if it is block-like, then some of its operations inside it should be fallthrough-able.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below are some special handling for some operations:</p>
<p><strong>ReturnOp</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If this is an implicit return, then it’s considered fallthrough-able if either (1) a fallthrough has already occurred earlier in the same container where the return op resides, or (2) this is the first operation encountered by the fallthrough analysis.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>SwitchOp</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the switch op is handling an enum and the switch handles all case of the enum or if the switch has a default case, and all of the cases (CaseOp) is fallthrough-able, then it not fallthrough-able. Otherwise, it is fallthrough-able</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CaseOp</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If one of the blocks in the operation is fallthrough-able, then it is fallthrough-able.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ScopeOp</strong> (this operation wraps around operation like switch)</p>
<ul>
<li>Same as CaseOp</li>
</ul>

<p>The new algorithm has some advantages and disadvantages over the old OG algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>More precise due to the extra context coming from the operation-nesting and block-nesting property.</li>
<li>Recursive, together with op and block-nesting nature allows for code reuse between different op handling (for example: CaseOp, ScopeOp and FuncOp uses the same logic)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disadvantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detection of reachable blocks (the equivalent is dead code elimination and then iterating over the remaining block) is not mature yet (see <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/174502" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/174502</a>).</li>
<li>Some attributes are not readily available (InferredNoReturnAttr, NoReturnAttr), requiring CIR to patch back into the AST to access those.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the progress was really positive, I regret not diving deeper into the reimplementation more. Now that I'm on a project
and going through learning new tooling, not much is left in pushing the implementation towards the finish line. Maybe one day :)</p>17:T224eb,<nav class="toc"><ol class="toc-level toc-level-1"><li class="toc-item toc-item-h1"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h1" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h1"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h1" href="#atuin-and-brtnvim">atuin and BRT.nvim</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h1"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h1" href="#components">Components</a><ol class="toc-level toc-level-2"><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#fzf-lua">fzf-lua</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#sqlite-lua">sqlite lua</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#tee">tee</a></li></ol></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h1"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h1" href="#features">Features</a><ol class="toc-level toc-level-2"><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#brtlog">BRTLog</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#quickfix-file">Quickfix file</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#sensible-behaviors">Sensible behaviors</a><ol class="toc-level toc-level-3"><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#keymaps">Keymaps</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#lsp-to-quickfix-for-current-file">LSP to quickfix for current file</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#pre-populating-commands">Pre-populating commands</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#priming-last-command-based-on-type">Priming last command based on type</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#returning-cursor">Returning cursor</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#auto-close-on-success">Auto-close on success</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h3"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h3" href="#auto-close-on-rerunning">Auto-close on rerunning</a></li></ol></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#atuin-like-ui">Atuin-like UI</a></li></ol></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h1"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h1" href="#ending">Ending</a></li></ol></nav><h1 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, it's been a while since my last blog that's focused on developer tooling itself. In this post, I want to talk about
a neovim plugin that I've made that has significantly improved my workflow productivity:
<a href="https://github.com/badumbatish/brt.nvim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BRT.nvim</a> :)</p>
<p>As always, here's this blog's music recommendation:

<p><a href="https://github.com/badumbatish/brt.nvim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BRT</a> stands for Build-Run-Test and the plugin's description on GitHub is "Build, run, and test your projects with 3 keystrokes."
The motivation for building this is that when programming, I'm invoking the build, run and test commands quite often;
I often alternate between the file in neovim that I'm coding and the terminal for invoking the commands
and reading command stdout and stderr, leading to quite inefficient processes.</p>
<p>The vision I have for BRT is that I would want to shorten the development cycle: "run the usual command as effortless as possible"
and to reduce the mental cognitive load from switching between the development file I'm in and the terminal.</p>
<p>Over time, I've also identified that when the command spits out an error including the location of a file,
it would take me some brain cells to find the line indicating the file, and then I also have to
remember which line number the error is on, and then I have to copy the faulty file name to my clipboard, and then
go back to neovim to find and open the file and then jump to the line number to see what the code on that line is, and then go back
to the terminal to read the error message for that line. Wewww, even reading all this makes my head a bit dizzy and almost cause me a stroke.
Now, imagine if the output has 4 or 5 such error locations, you can start to see why it's getting really messy really fast.</p>
<p>The above deficiency is not something that atuin can solve; being able to rerun a command quickly doesn't mean much when
the bottleneck is how you're locating the issue + debugging the problem as the command fails.</p>
<p>Throughout the blog, there are only pictures to showcase the behavior of the plugin. To actually observe how BRT works,
you can check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/YhTcO7IfGEU?si=DhXgf-RvwgCbQk_M" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">video</a> which also shows
the real time keystrokes when I'm invoking BRT.</p>
<p>For now, I hope this small text comparison would help you visualize the change in my workflow:</p>

<p>Now, let's dive in to see how I solve the aforementioned problems in BRT.nvim.</p>
<h1 id="components"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#components"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Components</h1>
<p>Now, building an <a href="https://atuin.sh/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">atuin</a> clone from pure scratch is going to be quite a task: self-implementing fuzzy finding, and writing a database from scratch
and handling stdout/stderr ourselves will be quite hefty work. Instead, we'll be offloading some of that capabilities to fzf-lua, sqlite
and tee.</p>
<p>Below shows a simplified diagram of how these things ties in together inside BRT.nvim</p>
<figure data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><pre tabindex="0" data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed" style="display: grid;"><span data-line=""><span>USER INPUT via &#x3C;leader>b, or &#x3C;leader>r or &#x3C;leader>t</span></span>

<p>Although the quickfix list is a component in BRT.nvim, I've decided to talk about it in the "Features" section
as it makes more sense there.</p>
<h2 id="fzf-lua"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#fzf-lua"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>fzf-lua</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fzf-lua</a>, in a few words, is basically fzf but in lua.</p>
<p>If you haven't heard of fzf, it is a searcher that updates your search result interactively as you type.
For up to tens of thousands of commands to fuzzy find over, you can easily
use <a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">telescope.nvim</a> as well. For this project, I simply picked fzf-lua because I
prefer the performance of fzf-lua over telescope for large repository.</p>
<p>Overall, the detailed docs and its ability to offload arguments to fzf itself means I can easily configure new keymaps as well as
search behaviors.</p>
<p>For example, all this readable code resides in lua itself:</p>

imo, this is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>With fuzzy-finding solved, the next big issue was persistence: how do we remember past commands? And who's supplying

<h2 id="sqlite-lua"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#sqlite-lua"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>sqlite lua</h2>
<p>Hahhaa, I'm not sure if there's anything else to be said about sqlite. In lieu of implementing the data as a big table and risk some run time errors over some minor details,
I let sqlite take care of the job of storing my commands.</p>
<p>For the schema, I store the command itself, the command type (build, run, or test), duration (how long it ran for), times inputted, timestamp for last inputted, as well as the exit code.</p>
<p>Regarding the portability of (aka the ability to remember) these commands when a user moves to a new machine (which is a thing that atuin offers),
I opted to create the sqlite database file as <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>vim.fn.stdpath("config") ..

Basically, I assumed that everybody that uses neovim will also be using some sort of dotfiles, and when they move to a new machine,
they will often use some tools like <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/stow.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stow</a> or <a href="https://www.chezmoi.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">chezmoi</a>, thus bringing the sqlite database file storing their
commands with them.</p>
<p>There is always the concern that logged commands could leak sensitive data, but since the project only focuses on commonly run commands such as <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>ninja</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="ninja" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none;

<p>When we're launching a user-selected command, naturally, we would want to record the output for future inspection.</p>
<p>With such commands, we launch it via jobstart(), which gives us finer control over how stdout and stderr is handled. We can, of course,
handle the output of stdout and stderr ourselves: combine them together and write to the log. However, doing so is quite laggy; when we're
using tee instead, some commands are able to recognize that the output is not to the terminal directly
(due to <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/isatty.3.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">isatty()</a>), thus reducing their printing
and fall back to a more static progress report. By piping the output through tee itself, we'll be able to save a lot of processing power
and storage this way.</p>
<p>A thing that I haven't thought about until I started adding tee to the executing command is that tee always returns 0,
rendering recording and reporting the exit code useless, that's why I add the following line to propagate the exit code
through tee itself: <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>&#x3C;your_default_shell> -o pipefail -c</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="<your_default_shell> -o pipefail -c" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span></p>

<p>In BRT.nvim, for this, when a command fails, besides the already-spawn terminal buffer, I also populate and spawn the quickfix list with all the command errors.
In this way, the quickfix list functionality acts as a personal reviewer for me, filtering out all the nonsense output and allowing me to focus my
mental capacity on fixing build errors instead of locating the build errors and opening the files pertaining to them.</p>

<h2 id="sensible-behaviors"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#sensible-behaviors"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Sensible behaviors</h2>
<p>One thing I learned writing BRT is that a good plugin isn't just about new features, it's about reducing mental page faults.
Anything that saves context switches and mental capacity for users should be treated analogously to magic.</p>
<p>Sensible behaviors that achieve the magic goal is quite hard to program for. After all, how can you expect to write a plugin that acts
just like your second skin: effortless and fun. Below lists a few sane and sensible behaviors that I've added to smoothen out the
brt.nvim workflow :)</p>
<h3 id="keymaps"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#keymaps"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Keymaps</h3>

<p>After spawning the terminal so that users can inspect the command output, I often notice that I would have to navigate
the cursor from the terminal back to the text file that I'm editing,
missing out a few keystrokes of efficiency. Thus, I've made it so that after we'd run a command,
the cursor automatically returns to the last location of the text file.</p>

allowing for some efficiency.</p>
<p>Hopefully after reading through this section, you'll realize that BRT.nvim have clearly separate itself from atuin :)
The clickbaity title where I said I built an atuin clone is really just to drive traffic and to give
you a sense of how the UI of BRT looks like - a bit like atuin.</p>
<h2 id="atuin-like-ui"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#atuin-like-ui"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Atuin-like UI</h2>
<p>Just like atuin, with fzf-lua, we're able to offer fuzzy finding. On top of that, the UI is more focused on the development feedback loop itself.
Since we don't care about how long since then we've run a command, BRT omits the "ago" feature and adds a column to display the exit code of the command; one thing
interesting to note is that when a command ran successfully, the exit code and the command duration is displayed in green, and red when its exit code is non-zero.
It also adds the command type as another column, either build, run or test.</p>

<p>I hope you've enjoyed reading through how a clone tool of atuin came to be inside neovim itself :) I know I've really
enjoyed writing the blog :)</p>
<p>BRT.nvim started on Aug 16 2024 as a simple neovim plugin that maps specific commands to certain types of projects
(cmake | cargo | npm | etc) without any UI/UX kind of improvements. A year and one month later,
after more clearly understanding my own pain points when programming, I feel like I've come a long way since then. BRT.nvim's new scheme
allows it to shine in areas where the old version would struggle: buggy in saving commands (no sqlite), not having a log file, no quickfix, no duration
or execution count, no fuzzy fnding, no
easy way to edit commands (user can only press <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>&#x3C;Enter></span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="<Enter>" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span> or they would have to go to neovim config to change the command).</p>

<p>Hello everyone, how's everybody doing? I'm still chugging away at solving LLVM issues at Igalia :) Fall and winter's
coming soon, and I can't wait to go travel and enjoy life. Hahaha Boston here I come :) Welp, another year a few
more blogs am I right hahahahhaa.</p>
<p>A few weekends ago, I went up to Thousand Oaks and Malibu beach to visit my friend from Berkeley and then took an Amtrak with a date to
San Diego. Isn't life just beautiful like that? I couldn't have asked for more.</p>
<p>As tradition, here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/6eefUmtgcp8?si=-_1GVJCO1lbz0JU3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">song</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvqfHcgIagI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another song</a> for interested readers :) I hope everyone enjoys :)</p>
<h1 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>Debugging has always been a quintessential tool in a software engineer's toolboxes. As a piece of software or framework gets more complicated, the flow of a program invariantly gets more complex, which requires software
engineers to careful and methodically investigate an issue/bug instead of blindly following one's instinct.</p>
<p>With how much time LLVM's been in development for, it evidently provides a wide range of tools to help a developer with problem-solving
when encountering a bug at run time or when an issue is filed.</p>
<p>In this sense, although the article title is about "debugging", the article inherently and inadvertently talks about problem-solving instead. I guess I lied hahahahahhaha.</p>
<p>I hope this helps junior LLVM developer or low level developer just starting out in their journey!</p>
<p>Welp, let's dig in!</p>
<h1 id="compiling-and-testing-time"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#compiling-and-testing-time"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Compiling and testing time</h1>
<p><img src="/blogs/hitchhiker_guide_to_llvm_debugging/compile_meme.png" alt="compile_meme"></p>
<p>Compile time on a big codebase has always been a pain point for programmers. A few seconds here, a few minutes there, and you have wasted
at least half an hour extra waiting to compile the LLVM repository. Once you hit compile, if you have to wait a while, your mind wanders away to other things, and you start to drift away, thinking about other topics.
Point is, the context switching causes you to lose out on your focusing power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compiling takes more time -> You have to wait longer -> Less time to run the code to experiment and debug -> cannot problem solve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following subsections then describes how to save time on your compiling and executing. This will reduce your development cycle time
and hopefully increase your productivity.</p>
<h2 id="release--assertion--debug"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#release--assertion--debug"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>(Release + Assertion) + (Debug)</h2>
<p>A common rule of thumb to have is that a codebase should be built in Debug mode when you're in development, and then in Release mode
when you're shipping to users. But this is not always the case...</p>
<p>If you're not stepping through the code with the LLDB debugger, chances are the trade-off of being in Debug mode such as receiving
accurate stack trace locations and source layout position is not worth it. Without going much into it right now, the LLVM codebase
provides much diagnostics help so that a majority of the time, stepping through the debugger is not necessary.</p>
<p>Debug mode takes longer to compile and link, test cases with Debug mode are often compiled and ran slower.
On the other hands, Release mode with assertion turned on compiles and run tests much faster without sacrificing much diagnostics.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's very beneficial to have two build modes when contributing to LLVM. You can set the modes for your build by appending these two options when configuring CMake</p>

<h2 id="build-your-targetsubproject-only"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#build-your-targetsubproject-only"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Build your target/subproject only</h2>
<p>You can also save on your development time by only building the subproject that are of interests to you.</p>
<p>For example, if you're doing the majority of the work on the Webassembly or X86 target,
you often don't have to enable the RISCV target and build RISCV source files on top of it.
Enabling extra targets will also enable extra tests for that target.</p>

<p>For datacenter applications, BOLT achieves up to 7.0% performance speedups on top of profile-guided function reordering and LTO.
For the GCC and Clang compilers, our evaluation shows that BOLT speeds up their binaries by up to 20.4% on top of FDO and LTO,
and up to 52.1% if the binaries are built without FDO and LTO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, for macOS users, BOLT only comes with Linux x86 and AArch64. However, I'd still recommend downloading your
OS's version of the compiler from LLVM's <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release page</a> as anecdotally, I can
still feel some extra perform when compiling LLVM.</p>
<p>After you've downloaded the LLVM release compiler to a folder, you can use it in your CMake configuration command as follows:</p>

<p>Btw, I learned about this through my conversation with David Spicket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bdbt: I'm new grad and joining a company as a compiler engineer, would compiling a new, separate compiler that's BOLT-activated specifically for compiling compiler makes sense?
It will give me a sizable reduction in compile time and allow for faster iteration, but I'm not sure if there will be errors when using the special version? any insights would be appreciated</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>David Spicket: At least for Linux x86 and AArch64, LLVM's release archives on GitHub are already BOLT-ed (you can check with objdump -h clang | grep bolt). So if there are potential issues, we're all at risk 🙂
If you want to try BOLT-ing something yourself, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/bolt/docs/OptimizingClang.md" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/bolt/docs/OptimizingClang.md</a> seems like a good place to start (I've not done this myself).</p>

<p>Haha, you thought we were done huh. Even on top of all this, we can use extra tools to squeeze out
extra time in our day-to-day work.</p>
<h3 id="ccache"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#ccache"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>ccache</h3>
<p>For increment builds, ccache "speeds up recompilation by caching previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is being done again."</p>
<p>Behind the scene, if not hashing based on inode (minimal accuracy), ccache will hash either the text directly or the preprocessed source code after compiler invocation (more accurate hashing).
At the time of writing this article (Aug 2025), <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/atc25-landsberg.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a new paper</a> has come out in July 2025, proposing even higher hash accuracy meanwhile driving down total time saving by proposing hashing on LLVM IR instead of source code or AST.
Here is an excerpt from said paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We demonstrate its accuracy and end-to-end savings in comparison to Ccache and cHash on the development history
of 16 open-source projects. With an average build time
reduction of 19% across all C projects, IRHash provides
better end-to-end savings than Ccache (10%) and cHash
(16%), while additionally supporting more languages.</p>

<p>From Ninja's wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In essence, Ninja is meant to replace Make, which is slow when performing incremental (or no-op) builds. This can considerably slow down developers working on large projects, such as Google Chrome which compiles 40,000 input files into a single executable. In fact, Google Chrome is a main user and motivation for Ninja. It's also used to build Android (via Makefile translation by Kati), and is used by most developers working on LLVM.</p>

<p>From the LLVM's LLD page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LLD is a linker from the LLVM project that is a drop-in replacement for system linkers and runs much faster than them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, it is so fast that I think it's a necessity to enable this by default when developing LLVM, especially when your
lld executable comes from the LLVM release page that has PGO and BOLT enabled, providing even faster linking time.</p>
<p>As of Monday, August 11, 2025, here is the comparison from the LLVM LLD page, with the percentage difference between ld, gold and lld.</p>

<h1 id="grepping"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#grepping"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Grepping</h1>
<p>Well, now all that's out of the way, let's talk about grepping.</p>
<p>In a big and unfamiliar codebase, sometimes, you just don't have much of a clue on how things go. In cases like this, you can
start querying random keywords that are related to your issue and work your way from there.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it just so happens that when you're querying a function that's used in a test case via an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LSP</a>,
the LSP gives you the source from the OS compiler or the LLVM release compiler (since you built the project with it), grepping might be
one of the few ways to get you to the function's source in the repository instead.</p>
<p>In my case, I opt for ripgrep instead of grep due to the <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep?tab=readme-ov-file#quick-examples-comparing-tools" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">performance difference</a>.</p>
<p>With such aforementioned importance, often in the following sections, I will try to provide how grepping integrates with each area.</p>

<p>For a beginner in a codebase (even a seasoned programmer),
the ability to obtain more information and context,
extending further than the code sitting in front of them, is extremely helpful. This section then talks about how to find new
extra information with git when browsing the codebase.</p>

<p>In investigating an issue through commits, it's also helpful to look up on the internet for the commit's pull requests,
either through GitHub or through <a href="reviews.llvm.org">reviews.llvm.org</a>, often known back then as Fabricator.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Backstory time: Before roughly 2020, pull requests to LLVM are through Fabricator (<a href="reviews.llvm.org">reviews.llvm.org</a>). Due to how long LLVM's been in developement,
it is often the case that the last time a line of code's been touched by a PR is through Fabricator. Thus, if you couldn't find the
pull request of the current commit hash through GitHub, a good place to try is Fabricator. In a PR back then, the Fabricator link of the pull request
would often be included in the commit message as well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, in this <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D124685?id=431828#inline-1213666" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pull request</a>, the author and reviewers have added a TODO, but without reading the PRs,
the TODO would seem very unclear and hazy, leaving code readers wanting more context.</p>
<p>In other words, exploring code is the first step, after that, commit messages provides greater additional context on the problems being solved and finally, the pull request
and the <a href="reviews.llvm.org">reviews.llvm.org</a> provides opinions and directives.</p>

<p>With trying to explore what's happening for a subproject/subsection in LLVM, you can also utilize grepping in git instead of going through the GitHub online gui.</p>

Buttt, such a simple description couldn't possibly do the site its justice;
besides linking this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSkpMdDe4g4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">entertaining video</a>, this section also highlights some of the helpful tooling of godbolt.
While the goal in the section is to introduce to newcomers of LLVM to the godbolt tool, it's also helpful to guide
beginners to how to simulate such behavior locally on their machines via the command line.</p>
<p>Welp, let's get to it.</p>
<h2 id="mapping"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#mapping"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Mapping</h2>
<p>First feature that I have found very useful from godbolt is the ability to point out which line of high level code is
responsible for which line of low level code (i.e. llvm ir or assembly code). This helps developer cuts down on trying to
identify which block of assembly code is responsible for</p>
<p>This is enabled by default and might be overlooked; thus, let's look at example.</p>

<p>The above picture shows godbolt each section in C code and in LLVM IR being color-coded. More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>The light turquoise color maps line 1 in C to line 1 in LLVM IR.</li>
<li>The yellow color maps line 2 in C to line 2-8 in LLVM IR.</li>
<li>The purple color maps line 3 in C to line 9 in LLVM IR.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're new to LLDB specifically and LLVM in general, the <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lldb</a> website gives pretty good direction.</p>
<p>It gives two options for newcomers: a <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/use/tutorial.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">tutorial</a> and a <a href="https://lldb.llvm.org/use/map.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cheatsheet</a>
of some sort to map GDB commands to LLDB commands.</p>

<h2 id="conditional-breakpoints"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#conditional-breakpoints"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Conditional breakpoints</h2>
<p>A conditional breakpoint in LLDB is just like a normal breakpoint, except it only stops when some boolean expression you provide evaluates to true.
So instead of halting every time execution hits that line or function, LLDB evaluates your condition first. If the condition is false, execution just keeps running.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how helpful the condition breakpoints are in LLVM. Personally, if I really need to have a condition
breakpoint in LLVM, I would rather construct a new <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>if</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="if" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span> as my breakpoints.</p>

<p>Being a industry-ready project itself, naturally, every time a contributor open a PR, they must accompany the code changes with
a test. Therefore, it's important to know at least on a high level, how testing works in LLVM :)</p>
<h2 id="fundamentals"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#fundamentals"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Fundamentally, testing in LLVM is driven by three tools: <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lit</a>, <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FileCheck</a>

<p>lit orchestrate how the tests are run (which compiler flags to use, which compiler executable to run), FileCheck determines if
the IR generated by the compiler behaves as expected or not and UTC automatically updates the generated IR in the file to the
newest iteration, reducing manual human costs when updating test case.</p>
<p>Below shows a simple test snippet (llvm/test/CodeGen/WebAssembly/simd.ll) that includes all three tools together:</p>

<h2 id="llvm-ir"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#llvm-ir"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>LLVM IR</h2>
<p>A lot of the test cases in LLVM IR can be auto generated by UTC. There are a few cases where you'll encounter handwritten test cases
combined with regex pattern matching.</p>
<h2 id="mlir"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#mlir"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>MLIR</h2>
<p>In MLIR, tests are more likely hand-written due to the natural evolving nature of the framework itself, together with the ever-changing
syntaxes of dialect due to the natural evolving nature of the framework itself, together with the ever-changing
syntaxes of dialects. Auto-updating all check lines would cause tests to churn massively and obscure meaningful changes.</p>
<p>MLIR maintainers want more pattern-based tests that cares for specific operations, attributes, or transformations, and provides more resiliency to syntax changes.</p>
<p>With this in mind, tests often requires ingenuity and are often opinionated by both the test writers and the reviewers.
Of course, this would also mean tests are longer to write up, and if not meeting the threshold by reviewers, will be rewritten.</p>

<p>A small tip to note is that when a .td file is table-generated, it spits out an .inc (<span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>include</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="include" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span>) file in the build folder.

<p>Developers often have a love hate relationship with tablegen, for example, with Jeremy Kun's perspective on MLIR's tablegen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It sounds nice, but I have a love hate relationship with tablegen. I personally find it to be unpleasant to use, primarily because it provides poor diagnostic information when you do things wrong. Today, though, I realize that my part of my frustration came from having the wrong initial mindset around tablegen. I thought, incorrectly, that tablegen was an abstraction layer. That is, I could write my tablegen files, build them, and only think about the parts of the generated code that I needed to implement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, my experience with tablegen in the backend is akin to this:
for certain issues/problems, if you don't use tablegen, then you'll end up writing more code and spend more time/effort maintaining said code.
A problem with the tablegen language is that it is often up to each
tablegen language consumer to interpret the language. I guess in a way, it feels more like a real, authentic language :)</p>
<p>I actually don't have much resource to provide here besides linking a really helpful thread on Google Groups <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/llvm-dev/c/aJCR1mBC0So/m/yZipPTzTCAAJ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'll be clipping the important part out for interested readers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thomas Lively: Part of the problem is that ISel patterns are like their own DSL inside the TableGen DSL, so keywords like "ins", "outs", and "ops" aren't keywords at the TableGen level, but rather at the level of the ISel system implemented with TableGen. Copying existing patterns and reading the comments in Target.td and TargetSelectionDAG.td are the best ways I know of learning how this works. I haven't seen a separate guide, although it would be very cool if one existed.</p>

<p>I'm not quite sure how applicable this is for the general audience (vscode &#x26; zed) but in vim/nvim, I did tablegen for
quite a bit before adding on syntax highlighting for tablegen.</p>

<p>After reading to this section, some reader from the crowd frustratedly yells out: "Gah damn Jas what the hell is this? This not the stone age, why all we got from this article is
grepping and syntax highlighting." And I agree, for a painstakingly long time, I'm also not aware that tablegen (and mlir) has already gotten an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LSP</a> server.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One thing that I want to note here for readers is that LLVM not only have the traditional clangd language server,
it also has the tablegen LSP, MLIR LSP, and MLIR PDLL LSP. How cool is this!!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the tablegen LSP, I can hover over a definition to see how is a class in tablegen declared. I can also go to the declaration as well as find references to a specific instance/class.
These tasks, which would mean a ton of grepping and manually looking through each file, would now be done at a click of a button.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tools/MLIRLSP/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LSP page</a> on the MLIR website details different features of the LSP as well as some demos with vscode.</p>
<p>For an overall look, the features include, but does not exclude:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live edit diagnostics.</li>
<li>Go to definition.</li>
<li>Find references.</li>
<li>Code completion.</li>
<li>Hover.</li>
<li>Navigation.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the time of speaking, vscode support and documentation are well documented on the website. I'm opening a pull request
to add more documentation on how to set up these LSP on neovim <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/154896" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.
As for zed and emacs, there is no current documentation on the page.</p>
<p>For my neovim readers,
I'm linking how I set up the LSP in my <a href="https://github.com/badumbatish/dotfiles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dotfiles</a>.</p>

<p>should spawn its own shell so git bisect run is not affected</p>
<p>The rest of this gitbisect section focuses on helping you set up a basic script to automate the bug finding process with gitbisect.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the work flow. Git bisect requires 3 things</p>
<ul>
<li>A bad commit hash where the error occurs. Usually, when people file an issue on LLVM, they'll also provide you with this hash.</li>
<li>A good commit hash where the error didn't occur back then.</li>
<li>A script that returns zero or non-zero when recreating the original error for git-bisect to binary search on which commit the error first happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>For lack of space, I link here a <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/117200#issuecomment-3109446894" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">comment on an issue</a> on how to perform git-bisect.</p>

<p>Just like how it sounds, this tool extracts a piece of code that is of relevance from a big file to a smaller file.</p>
<p>For a demo as of Mon Aug 18 2025, you can build the llvm repository and input this command to the terminal. This will extract

exactly the bug occurs.</p>
<p>The other way around also suffices. That is: you solve a bug, and then you want to reduce the llvm-ir test case to an acceptable
size to ensure that PR reviewers don't have to sweat too much reading the test case and that other future changes in the
codebase doesn't affect.</p>
<p>Here I give a minimal example on how to use llvm-reduce.</p>

<p>If you're interested in learning more about how to reduce LLVM crashes, nikic has a <a href="https://www.npopov.com/2023/10/22/How-to-reduce-LLVM-crashes.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">great article</a> on this.</p>

<p>Often times, an issue might be too hard for somebody just because they haven't encountered the issue before, or they haven't
read up the codebase or research the specific knowledge yet.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that, first times are always hard. I think the important mindset is to adopt is that it's ok to go back and
try again, nothing needs to be perfect. Sometimes a technical article is just too hard, so I just give up and try again the next day or the next week hahhhahha.</p>
<p>In this section, I'll also share some resources I've consumed throughout my two months at Igalia.</p>

<p>If even after you've read the article, and you're still not sure how to solve an issue, there's no shame in asking other people
for direction and for help :)</p>
<p>I think sometimes, seniors have trouble helping juniors out with a problem because neither of them have taken a jab at the problem yet.
Seniors haven't because they're often busy solving problems at a greater scope and juniors haven't because they're often not briefed on
where and how to take a jab of it. Hopefully with the tools presented in this article, I can help bridge the gap between the two parties; before going to
seniors for help, isolating incidental functions and/or files and providing crucial log files would prove very useful for both sides :)</p>
<p>Personally, I'm very thankful for both the open source community and my colleagues at Igalia for guiding me on my path of learning LLVM and
helping me out with issues and  pull requests.
It would be treacherous and nigh-impossible without them :)</p>

<h1 id="epilogue"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#epilogue"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Epilogue</h1>
<p>Welp, that's it for this one :) In writing this blog, here's what I hope to achieve with the blog. For newcomers, the article will
act as a guiding point to help them get started with problem-solving in their LLVM journey. For seniors, I hope that you can help me
contribute to this blog by either sending me resources through discord or giving me feedbacks on which part to improve.</p>
<p>I want to thank Igalia for allowing me to write this blog on company time :) I really enjoy writing the blog and would love
to write new blogs in the future hehehehh.</p>

<p>Let's talk about tiling first. I first learned about tiling through the PMPP book's example on matrix multiplcation. The transform tutorial couldn't have put it any better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tiling, in general, can be seen as partitioning the iteration space into smaller parts, or tiles, so that the data required by each part fits into a level of cache for example. The order in which tiles are executed must preserve the original data dependencies.</p>

<p>In the case of linalg.generic operations, the iteration space is implicit and is defined by the shape of the operands. Therefore, a tile can be expressed by performing the same operation on a subset (slice) of the original data</p>

<p>Hi everyone, how's everybody doing? :) I hope everybody's doing great :) I'm still doing good. I've moved back to
my parents' place in OC after graduated from Berkeley.</p>
<p>So, today's article is mostly a report on my current progress learning about the llvm codebase as well as all the
modifications I've made to my dotfiles since then. I hope everybody enjoys.</p>
<p>Also, as tradition, here's <a href="https://youtu.be/N8OHSXvneOE?si=G4ZzUuDYDsdkreG6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">First Steps</a> and

<h2 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Working on LLVM (with neovim btw as your text editor) can be a frightening process, especially for a beginner. Since
starting my
employment at
Igalia (you can find me <a href="https://www.igalia.com/team/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>!, how cool is thatttt!),
I've been learning a lot, as well as sharpening my dotfiles to increase my efficiency/productivity. In this article,
I'll report on what I've done since then, as well as any changes I've made to my dotfiles.</p>
<p>This article won't deep dive into the technicalities too much like <a href="/posts/what_I_did_for_gsoc_2024">the gccrs blog</a>,
but instead give a quick overview and then scoot right into the modifications of dotfiles together with their
reasoning for it.</p>

<h3 id="area-of-contribution"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#area-of-contribution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Area of contribution</h3>
<p>At Igalia currently, I'm tasked with contributing to the back end in WebAssembly and RISCV. Since then, I've
opened 7 issues and closed 3 of them. I've also opened 6 pull requests and closed 5 of them. Most of my PR dealt with
optimization on the
<a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1SelectionDAG.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SelectionDAG</a> framework in
the WebAssembly back end. I'm still investigating and watching a loop optimization issue for RISCV but not sure how
I'll solve it :)</p>
<p>A few notable PRs include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/145627" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PR145627</a>: I optimized the WebAssembly back end by querying the

<p>I want to emphasize that a lot of the issues that enabled these PRs were sourced by Luke. Without these issues, I'm
afraid I might still be searching for llvm issues on github without knowing their difficulty, wasting my own time
and efforts on unnecessary unfriendly-to-beginner issues. I'm thankful for his guidance for my first few steps.</p>
<h2 id="dotfiles-and-toolings"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#dotfiles-and-toolings"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Dotfiles and toolings</h2>
<p>Alright hahhaha nice, we've finally got over the technical part, let's talk about my
<a href="https://github.com/badumbatish/dotfiles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dotfiles</a>.</p>
<p>During the first few weeks at Igalia, a lot of modifications were made to my dotfiles configuration to allow for
more efficient workflow.</p>
<p>The dotfiles is thus geared towards neovim/tmux/MacOS and my job, which is compiler development.</p>
<p>Here, I'm providing readers with detailed reasoning for my modifications of my dotfiles. Interested readers can
find the most up to date docs and reasoning through this <a href="https://github.com/badumbatish/dotfiles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dotfiles link</a>.</p>
<p>Before blindly initializing and running the commands in this dotfile, do your due diligence first and read through every link here if you're not familiar with one. You can also dive into the configuration files themselves.</p>
<h3 id="why"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#why"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Why?</h3>
<p>A very, very smart CS person in my compiler class at uni once told me something along
the line of "use/build your tool very well" and I feel like
I want to share it in this blog. The use case of when he told me might be different
, but the principle still remains the same: regardless if it's about the compiler, terminal tool, or
your IDE, it really pays off to learn how to use your tool so good that it
completely boosts your productivity into a different dimension.</p>
<p>In my case, automating to shave seconds off each time I compile, test, debug or query my code really reinforces the
dev cycle, making me lose less mental capacity and gain more efficiency.</p>
<p>Alright, that's all the yapping. Let's get to it :)</p>

<li>Cut downs from (at minimum) 20 keystrokes to (at most) 4 keystrokes to register my new modifications.</li>
<li>Waste no time waiting for chezmoi to add, write my commits and push as there is a script guaranteeing that each time
it's the same
result.</li>

<p>Although not explicitly mentioned anymore in the next few sections, you can expect each new tooling introduced will
have the same positive effects that are mentioned in this section: a few more seconds/minutes here and there will add

<h3 id="window-manager-wm"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#window-manager-wm"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Window Manager (WM)</h3>
<p>On MacOS, I'm currently using <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">yabai</a> together with <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/skhd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">skhd</a> to drive my window management setup. Have a quick read about them if you haven't got a chance.</p>
<p>Using a Window Manager alleviates my reliance on the built-in mousepad and relieves me from programming <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1dx9qgr/wrist_hurts_from_too_much_programming/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wrist pain</a></p>

<p>Atuin is an automatic fuzzy finding tool for your terminal commands. It has helped me so much with rerunning my building and testing commands and has saved me hours of work.</p>
<p>I recommend you check out their <a href="https://atuin.sh/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a> and watch the demo for yourself.</p>
<p>In my opinion, it's a pretty essential tool for all CLI users.</p>
<h3 id="kitty"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#kitty"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Kitty</h3>
<p>Kitty is my chosen terminal. I switched from iterm2 to Kitty for the following reason:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPU acceleration: Kitty is smoother and faster than iterm2, this is important on a big codebase like llvm due to its massive improvement on rendering speed (rendering text in a big codebase in neovim on iterm2 is a pain.)</li>
<li>Configuration ease: configuration for Kitty is extremely easy: everything is in 1 single file, from themes to extra shortcuts.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you're doing software dev on a big codebase, aesthetics is an afterthought instead of <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/performance/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">performance/speed</a>.</p>
<p>I also configure a few sane commands in Kitty for faster project maneuver:</p>

<p>Back before starting my employment @ Igalia, I relied on <a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">telescope</a> for all of my fuzzy finding. It turns out telescope is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/ura4vu/telescope_too_slow_for_large_directories/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">really really slow</a> on big repository, even with ripgrep in place of grep.</p>
<p>With fzf-lua being soooo sooo so customizable, I then turned my focus to said library and hasn't looked back since.</p>

<p>A cool thing about fzf-lua is I can add nvim-treesitter-context as a dependency, which gives me extra context for every match in a file. This makes it so that for example, if I'm searching for a string or a variable in C++, I can instantly know which function the variable is residing in.</p>

<p>For a beginner in a codebase (even a seasoned programmer), the ability to obtain more information and context, extending further than the code sitting in front of them, is extremely helpful.
Furthermore, small quality-of-life ability such as staging the current selected change to git add (instead of git adding the whole file) is very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the past 3 weeks, I think my speed of absorbing new llvm knowledge is satisfiable. Regrettably, a lot
of the modifications to my dotfile were not in place when I was going through implementing a few of my llvm pull
requests. This meant that my speed was essentially reduced or wasted on typing commands that could have been
automated. All of these frictions lose me a few seconds and my developer mental capacity here and there, which adds
up to
hours
over the course
of a
week.</p>
<p>Whoopsies, anyways hahahaha. Here's to a more productive time at Igalia.

<p>Hi everyone, how's everyone doing? It's been a while since I've written another blog. I'm doing good :) This May
2025,
I'm graduating and happy to announce that I'm starting my employment at Igalia this June hacking on compilers :)</p>
<p>Igalia is a
"worker-owned, employee-run cooperative model consultancy focused on open source software" and I'm so happy I am
accepted and offered to work here. I'll be working remotely from home, hacking on compilers :) Besides the
diversity and the worker cooperative model, family and work-life
balance also play a huge role in my life, hence my pick for Igalia.</p>
<p>During my compiler-focused recruiting time, in interviews, I got asked a lot of compiler-related questions and I felt
really
under-prepared for them. I have some experience in compilers, but there wasn't a database like leetcode
that you
can turn to to practice and hone your compiler skills. I want to write this article to talk about compiler (related)
questions
asked in interviews,
to share with everyone who's
looking for a junior job; maybe it can help you with your compiler recruiting.</p>
<p>I want to also extend my acknowledgement to everyone who believed in me and supported me throughout, including, but
not excluding:</p>
<ul>
<li>My family: you already know what it is haha</li>
<li>Emi &#x26; Noah: for being there for me, for sleepovers, and helping me with offer decisions :)</li>
<li>Lizzie: your mom hhahahah</li>
<li>Tim: For your help in the Igalia process.</li>
<li>Ish: for your "youll b fine" and "itll b fine" affirmations :)</li>
<li>Quân: for Yosemite and for everything since 2023.</li>
<li>Carol: For your acceptance and support to me during Fermilab's CCI and SULI program. You helped shape my early-early-early career.</li>

Companies are asking (compiler) questions that are often not
addressed in your average compiler class, and it's hard to be prepared for them; you ask ChatGPT to
prep up some
questions for you, but it doesn't seem to go into details much. In this article, I want to put together all the
(compiler related)
questions I've been asked so that you can hopefully get a head start in your recruiting.</p>
<p>Company names will be replaced by names of dishes for anonymity reasons, and to also avoid tunnel-visioning. There
won't be any name-dropping. There
also won't be no behavioral questions mentioned. Interviewers will be addressed in the commonly used gender-neutral
pronoun they/them.</p>
<p>All the code I have written for the interviews (including pseudocode) is in C++17/20.</p>
<p>The questions compiled here,
as well as my perspective on each interview round, have been written since November 2024.</p>
<p>If a question doesn't have a hint, that's because the answer is either too broad, too personal, too hard or the hint
might
have been too obvious.</p>
<p>If a company's process doesn't have any result, that's because of the company's anonymity as well as to avoid
tunnel-visioning for readers.</p>
<p>For transparency, the résumé that I used for the recruiting cycle is

Here is my <a href="https://github.com/badumbatish" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://leetcode.com/u/badumbatish/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">leetcode</a>.</p>
<h2 id="pre-december-2024"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#pre-december-2024"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Pre-December 2024</h2>
<p>During this time starting between Aug 2024 to December 2024, my mind was still dull and unsharpened. Limited interviews
and leetcoding
from the previous year have frozen my leetcode, technical and behavioral interview skills.
I started and had been doing
leetcode on the daily throughout the timeline to get back into the game.</p>
<p>Having bought leetcode premium (for editorial viewing), I also joined the leetcode discord server to help keep me in
check. Back then, I also did
every daily problem on the leetcode website. It's really cute :) You get to have a medal at the end of the month if
you don't miss any day; they also have two rewind tickets for you if you miss a day.
I also focused a lot on easy and medium, and oftentimes I came back to the same problems multiple times to imprint
the problems in my brain.</p>
<p><img src="/blogs/compiler_questions_where_to_find_them/medals.jpg" alt="medals"></p>
<p>By the time the pre-December period ended, I
would have done around 350
leetcode
problems.</p>
<p>Beginning of August 2024, I hadn't yet taken any advanced compiler course, nor had I been focused on my own toy
compiler project. The GSoc project for gccrs had just started to wrap up; with now only two compiler projects, I was
still struggling to frame my
résumé in
the best light for
potential compiler employers.</p>
<h3 id="pad-kee-mao"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#pad-kee-mao"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Pad Kee Mao</h3>
<p>One of my first interviews for the recruiting season.
4 rounds of technical interviews. The company really loves leetcode-typed questions.</p>
<h4 id="round-1"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#round-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Round 1</h4>
<p>Question is <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iv/description/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leetcode 1462 - Course Schedule IV</a></p>
<p>A classic graph traversal problem that's solvable by DFS or BFS.
I read the problem statement and coded up the solution, step by step explaining it to them.</p>
<p>There were some bugs in my code.
But I debugged it and fixed it right away.
After the code passed the test case, the interviewer asked how I can speed it up.
I answered by using cache on the edges of the graph.
The interviewer then explained that caching was good but hinted that caching on the nodes of the graph was more
efficient.
I paused for a bit, asked them to explain to me why caching on nodes is better (lol). After a minute or two, I agreed
with them and provided
pseudocode for the
implementation.</p>
<p>Shortly after this, we ended the interview.</p>
<h4 id="round-2"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#round-2"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Round 2</h4>
<p>Question is <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leetcode 40 - Combination Sum II</a></p>
<p>Another DFS problem that's powered by backtracking. I think anybody who's done some leetcode has seen it. Personally,
I'd recommend readers to also solve
<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leetcode 17 - Letter Combinations of a Phone Number</a>
and <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/ways-to-express-an-integer-as-sum-of-powers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leetcode 2787</a>.
I spent around 10–15 minutes to walk over an example, asked the interviewer about the constraints as well as coding up
the implementation.</p>
<p>There were 2–3 followup questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the time and space complexity of this? (Hint: constant time for an upper limit on the input size, but please
explain
this in
detail)</li>
<li>How do we make sure we don't waste time computing the combination sums that
doesn't
have an
answer?
(Hint: think
about the comparison between the sum of all elements and the target being asked)</li>
<li>Given a big list of elements to sum up, and a large number n, and around 1000–2000 machines, at a high level, how
would you parallelize this? (Hint: think about when you first split up the big problem into smaller subproblems, how
that exposes the independence between them.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the interviewer didn't ask me about the time and space complexity when the input isn't bounded, I think
it's a good exercise to try and figure it out. Some pencil and paper would suffice.</p>
<h4 id="round-3"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#round-3"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Round 3</h4>
<p>The interviewer started with non-leetcode questions, then they transitioned into leetcode questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>(Why is)/(Give a reason why) hardware important for faster inference of machine learning models? (Hint: think
about information/memory traversing time in the hardware, how custom hardware can make this better, don't be afraid
to ask ChatGPT for some help, I did it after the interview ended, you might as well do it before the interview hahaha)</li>
<li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leetcode 198 - House Robber</a> - A simple 1d-DP problem.</li>
<li><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-increasing-elements/description/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leetcode 2016 - Maximum difference between increasing elements</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Follow-ups on leetcode questions were still the same: "what's the time and space complexity?"</p>
<h4 id="round-4"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#round-4"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Round 4</h4>
<p>The interviewer provided me with the schematics for the untyped
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lambda calculus</a> syntax and asked me to code up a
recursive
descent lexer/parser combination for
it. I was
kind of taken off guard
by the question a bit. But I had been hand-writing recursive descent parser in my compiler project as well as for
gccrs, so I kinda got the
general idea.</p>
<p>I was relieved (?!) that they didn't ask about operator precedence climbing as well as Pratt parsing as I didn't get
into them until after December 2024.</p>
<p>In this economy,
it's hard to know what questions will be thrown at you. Please be prepared for operator precedence climbing and
pratt parsing by implementing a simple calculator with +, -, *, /, (, ) yourself. As they always say, it's better to
learn in the practice
exam than in the exam itself.</p>
<p>I heard back a week later that I didn't get the job.
The lack of behavioral preparedness, together with the nervousness, got to me.</p>
<p>I was quite desolate and crushed. That week, each breath was shaky and heavy.</p>
<h2 id="post-december-2024"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#post-december-2024"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Post-December 2024</h2>
<p>The post-December era seemed like Luffy's post-timeskip in One Piece.</p>
<p>Interviewing with a lot of stray companies has made me more indifferent, more efficient and better at
the recruiting process. Ghosting or generic rejections don't bother me as much. Rejections just mean there are better
candidates than me; they are a much better fit than me, and that I need to strive to better myself more.</p>
<p>I learned that in a competitive market, it is important to market oneself to the employers. Thus, I polished my
website and published a lot of blogs, and posted them on LinkedIn, X, bluesky for visibility, meanwhile
advertising
in each blog article that I am actively looking for a full time compiler job. For LinkedIn visibility, my school
offered a free 6 months of LinkedIn Premium, which boosted my viewership. An
employee from a
company
has reached out, as well as recruiters from top companies to offer referral or advancement to bypass OA and straight to
the interviewing stage. More often than not, I reached out to employees myself, and had secured a
few referrals for myself.</p>
<p>It is important to keep on improving and advocating for yourself, especially in an over-saturated market, whether it is
through
your projects, leetcode,
résumé or
general marketing and networking. I can't stress that fact enough; please never forget that.</p>
<p>I am much more confident in my interviewing skills now.
My résumé's also been much more refined with my graduate class
project.
By the time I wrapped up my recruitment process, my leetcode count has hit 520+, compared to the pre-December period
of ~350 leetcodes.</p>
<h3 id="macaroni-and-cheese"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#macaroni-and-cheese"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Macaroni and Cheese</h3>
<p>3 rounds of technical leetcode interviews. I'm beginning to be convinced that companies really like leetcode questions,
even in
compilers.</p>
<h4 id="round-1-1"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#round-1-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Round 1</h4>
<p>A leetcode-styled question on a string-stack-parsing problem.</p>
<p>Given a string of "add(mul(5, 2), 3)", produce the final numeric answer.</p>
<p>Hint: if you're a compiler person, at a
high level,
think
about this in terms of phases, from the perspective of lexing tokens first, and then transition into parsing.</p>
<p>The interviewer then asked me to provide the complexity of the problem.
End of round, they asked "which area interests you the most in cs, and why?" of course the answer is "compilers"
hahahaha.
They also asked "outside of your technical areas, what do you enjoy doing." I said "reading up on social issues and
technical writings."</p>
<h4 id="round-2-1"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#round-2-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Round 2</h4>
<p>Another leetcode-styled question, this one is named "Bit-flip."</p>
<p>Given a monochrome bitmap represented as a flat array of bytes, with one bit per pixel, flip it horizontally in-place.
The follow-up question was "if you have a lot of requests, what kind of optimization/parallelization can you perform?"</p>
<p>The problem was 3-fold. It tested if the interviewee could map indices from 2D array to 1D array. It then tested if
interviewee was comfortable with bit manipulation. Finally, it tested the interviewee's ability to parallelize the
problem.</p>
<p>After this, there were two followup questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"If, in testing, If my implementation of an algorithm from a paper runs twice as slow when I double the specific
testing
input size from

to do with plotting and coefficients and hidden constants)</li>

<h4 id="round-3-1"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#round-3-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Round 3</h4>
<p>Weww, it's raining BFS and DFS everyone.
This time it's another modified version of an official problem that I know of:
<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/description/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leetcode 63 - Unique Paths II</a></p>
<p>I didn't have much passing impression with this round, except that the interviewer was much more interested in our
high level discussion, which took up about 1/3 of our interview time, leaving little time for implementation; I
managed to somehow still get it below the time limit.</p>
<p>Towards the end, we bonded over our usage of vim/nvim in
our daily work life :)</p>

superduper crackhead hard.
I could only come up with the naive solution. Personally, I struggled to understand the reasoning behind asking this
question; there are more productive and efficient ways to go about testing an interviewee's knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>To make up for my lack of AI skills, the interviewer then gauged my knowledge of the compiler's middle end:</p>

<p>In this round as well as round 1, in retrospect, I don't think I could come up with the (efficient) solution
without seeing them previously. It is sadly the current state of affairs in an employers' market.</p>
<p>The interviewer also asked me stuff about C++, a few examples are: "what's a smart pointer?", "when you first
construct a unique ptr, it assumes the ownership of object, yet you can still assign the construction of that unique
ptr to a variable, why is that?" (Hint: std::move and rvalue), "How do shared ptrs work?" (Hint: reference counting).</p>
<h4 id="round-3-2"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#round-3-2"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Round 3</h4>
<p>The interviewer started off with "how would you lower a convolution down to some specific architecture or to a lower
form of IR?" (Hint: I actually have no hint. I don't know how to answer this question...)</p>
<p>Interviewer also asked about my projects with GPU and AI. I didn't have much experience in the areas and thus could
not answer either question. I transferred to UC Berkeley 1.5 years ago and could only have so much time to learn so
many different courses; sadly, compilers and algorithms were prioritized instead of GPU and AI. I was
still
trying to improve in the area and was feeling pretty defeated. The
interview
ended shortly after.</p>

<p>The screening round (round 1) started off with
<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/description/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Leetcode 509 - Fibonacci</a> - simple, but you'll soon
realize :)</p>
<p>This round was designed to test the interviewee's software engineering skills and practices. A lot of refactoring was
needed throughout all the iterations. I'm glad I know vim pretty well to handle all the code changes.</p>
<p>Interviewer asked me to implement the naive, recursive approach. Then moved on to ask me how I would test them and
asked me
to come up with different ways to test this. They also asked me to make sure the test wasn't just reusing the linear
pattern: testing <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>1</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(1)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>, then <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>2</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(2)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">2</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span>, then <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>3</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(3)</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">3</span><span class="mclose">)</span></span></span></span> as the implementer could easily exploit the linear nature.</p>

hahha.</p>
<p>They said this could work. But another (easier) way was to perform randomized testing: pick a number randomly in a
range and
test it; repeat this for <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>k</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">k</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03148em;">k</span></span></span></span> times.</p>

During this time, I really felt I've nailed it down, so I took initiative, asked the interviewer to trust me and let me code the implementation.</p>
<p>Things slowly got more complicated. They then asked for the iterative version's run time and memory complexity. I was
also asked to test the iterative
version as well,
so I then
had to

<p>This round was all about the front end as well as the general type-checking.</p>
<p>The interviewer asked me about the different phases of the compiler and how it works (front-end, middle-end, back-end).

willing to dabble in and learn anything.</p>
<p>The interviewer then asked me about my toy compiler project, and what I plan to do next with it. I told them, "I
probably
would want to implement a type checker in the compiler." They then iterated on this, saying "ok, how would you assign
types in

<p>We moved on to talk about if-else type checking. They wanted me to provide pseudocode (in a CoderPad) that type
checks an
If-else expression. I had to quickly make up a struct-like version of the If-Else expr, gave them the high level
overview (of what a laywoman thinks) on what it means that an if-else expression is checked successfully. I asked
them a lot of questions about the language's syntax and the assumption that I could make behind the type system.</p>
<p>💡Jas here with more hints💡. A few
examples you can ask are:</p>
<ul>
<li>"Has the visitor (and walker) pattern been implemented for me?"</li>
<li>"Have the types already been assigned for me, so I can just check them?"</li>

<p>Be sure to not assume too much, because by then the interviewer could grade your abilities as "not good" since
you have nothing to show for yourself. Asking good assumptions is a skill to be trained for.</p>
<p>For visualization, I typed something similar to this for the AST's struct:</p>

<p>They then followed up with "given two types A and B, how would you find out the lowest supertype (LS) of those two
types?"
After
this, they then followed up on the followup with "now that you have a way to find out the
LS of 2 types, with this tool in mind, how would you go on to check the LS of k types?" (Hint: Draw
out a
diagram as a tree representing all the types in your language, with the supertype of all types at the root of the tree.)</p>
<p>We then ended the interview.</p>
<h4 id="introspection"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introspection"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introspection</h4>
<p>In all rounds at Honey Almond Cream Cheese Bagel, I struggled through round 2 the most. I got all the
knowledge needed to ace the round, but nobody had told me: "this is how you combine everything together Jaz." I'm
glad I went through the trials.</p>
<p>This company featured the most interactive interview style in the whole line up, just a bit
behind Takoyaki. A lot of the questions being asked in this company's interviews really made me think hard about my
answers. It's clear to say their challenging questions blended perfectly between practicality, depth and theory.</p>
<p>Looking back, I think working more on my toy compiler would have helped a lot.
If I had
implemented a simple bidirectional type
checker for my compiler, the if-else expr type checking question would have been easier—I could have been more
methodical in my answers.
If I had enrolled in
one of
our school's upper divisions in "software-hardware architecture" instead of "randomized processes and algorithms,"
answering
the
question on
assembly lowering could have been smoother. Ah well, maybe one day when
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(probability_theory)" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">martingales</a> show up in compilers :) Whatever, we work
with what we have :)</p>
<p>It was also during this time period that I realized not every answer needed to be perfect. Oftentimes, as long as I
managed to spell out the keywords that the interviewers were looking for, or as long as I was progressing towards the
goal, interviewers were willing to guide me to get to the question's answer myself.</p>
<p>The recruiter
thankfully gave me very helpful feedback: "you have some of the
skills the team is looking for, but it's not there yet." I was grateful for the recruiter and the team's honesty.
Needless to say,
what
followed next was a rejection.</p>
<p>As I'm writing this article, I shudder to think about my past selves and all the times I've been rejected: "I hope the
past Jasmine didn't attribute her self-worth to a result
of an interview process." I hope you don't either - we play the card we're dealt with, and refuse to let them define us.</p>
<h3 id="takoyaki"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#takoyaki"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Takoyaki</h3>
<p>The Takoyaki company process was completely different from the rest of the line-up. If Honey Almond Cream Cheese
Bagel wanted to gauge my skills through providing actual pseudocode for simulated problems, then Takoyaki opted for
high frequency of questions in randomly different areas that were tailored specifically to my résumé.</p>
<p>Interviewing with the company felt like talking to a colleague instead of being quizzed on a test with leetcodes. I
felt like I was also contributing to the conversation, it was amazing :)</p>
<p>The Takoyaki was also one of the few companies that scores really high in respect their transparency. They clearly set the
interview expectation, told me straight from the start, "there won't be any leetcode, we're gonna talk about your
résumé," and talk we did!</p>
<p>Gosh I hope I'm not gushing over Honey Almond Cream Cheese Bagel and Takoyaki too much. At least now you know which of
the listed dishes are my favorites (together with Phở of course) :)</p>

<p>I also like redbull :) if you like this article, maybe consider

<h4 id="round-1--2"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#round-1--2"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Round 1 &#x26; 2</h4>
<p>The company seemed really
interested in
trying to know me
as a person,
through my résumé as well as my thoughts on certain topics.
As a result, they asked me a ton of questions about my résumé, about
<a href="what_I_did_for_gsoc_2024">my experience in GSoc gccrs</a>, about
MLIR, about the difference between GCC IR versus LLVM IR; let's just say that if
a project has the word
"compiler" or "programming languages,", they were gonna ask, in detail, each word and each line that I wrote in the
résumé. It really felt like they were looking for an independent thinker who's also a problem solver in their own
ways.</p>
<p>They also asked me that in one of my compiler projects, did it have error reporting? I reluctantly said no, and that's
why I
incorporated that feature and wrote about it in this <a href="what_after_kalei_location_debug">article</a>.</p>
<p>There are also non-résumé questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>"What's the most important thing in software engineering, according to you?" - I told the interviewer that
it's "building tools."</li>
<li>"On a high level, how would you debug a JIT compiler?" — Hahah this is a hard question. I talked about how
difficult it is to
debug a JIT compiler instead. It seemed to suffice.</li>
<li>"On a high level, how would you debug/detect a memory bug?" — Static analyzer, sanitizers, valgrind, gdb, and lldb.</li>
<li>"How useful do you think AI is in your day-to-day workflow?" — It's not good enough, but it's helpful for searching
for documentation.</li>
<li>"What, to your knowledge, might be a difference in a compiler's AST and HIR?" (Hint: syntax desugaring, custom SSA
IR form, sometimes it also happens that your compiler typechecking and such only exists in the HIR level (this is
true in gccrs) so even though there might be no difference in a compiler AST and HIR, there is a difference in the
visitor pattern in a compiler's AST and HIR stage)</li>
<li>"Describe how you would debug an issue that popped up on your most recent commit" - Domain specific knowledge and

<li>"What OS would you like to use for compiler dev?" — I answered them: "I have a Macbook right now, but it's a pain to
set up LLVM on macOS, I'd like to switch to Ubuntu, it's just a popular linux distribution."</li>
<li>"What's your favorite programming language?" — I actually don't know if I have a favorite language :) Rust is

them. C++ scores pretty high on the nostalgic feel as well. It's hard.</li>
<li>"What's your experience with CI/CD?"</li>

</ul>
<p>I hope to appeal to potential interviewers that although not a single leetcode questions or programming
questions
were asked in both rounds, the interviews at Takoyaki were still highly technical and demanding of the interviewee.</p>
<p>Again, to potential interviewers, if your interview questions are pre-determined by your hiring manager or company
policy, I hope
you and others advocate for a
better interview process that's decoupled from leetcode problems; this is not just for the interviewee's sake but
also for
your own
sake, lest you risk hiring someone who can only solve leetcode instead of a true junior compiler engineer.</p>
<h3 id="phở"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#phở"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Phở</h3>
<p>I have a disclaimer to make. There wasn't any company that interviewed for only 3 rounds or fewer, except Takoyaki.
Most of them interviewed for 4 or 5 rounds, even 6; in protecting companies' anonymity, I need to cut out some questions
that might reveal them and put them here.
Phở is actually
not a single company. But it's
actually an
amalgamation of different
companies' questions that were asked. I want to add all the relevant questions
that I was asked, not a
single question wasted.
Hence, the name.</p>

<h1 id="evaluation-and-introspection"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#evaluation-and-introspection"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Evaluation and Introspection</h1>
<p>Below shows a Sankey graph of my progress.
<img src="/blogs/compiler_questions_where_to_find_them/stats_1.png" alt="stats_1"></p>
<p>You'll find it interesting (or not hahah) that all of my success leading into phone screen/interview didn't go
through online assessments; none of my attempts in OA got me through the next round.</p>
<p>One point of insight is that mass/cold applying to every role on the internet didn't lead to much: applying within
my area of specialization seemed to yield much better results.</p>
<p>There was no résumé customization for each job; I submitted to all jobs using the same one.</p>
<p>I should also note that for 15 phone screen/interview, there were</p>
<ul>
<li>8 companies doing AI/GPU compiler.</li>
<li>5 companies doing traditional compiler work.</li>
<li>2 companies doing quantum computing compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a new grad who has limited knowledge in AI/GPU, the odds were somewhat stacked against me: companies seemed to
want AI/GPU as the main driver, with compiler knowledge on the side.</p>
<p>There were 5 companies (with their job postings) that promote open source work.</p>
<p>In total, 6 companies were Big Tech. 2 were
consultancies, and the rest were startups.</p>
<p>Another point of interest is that for all companies that I've gotten into phone screen/interview, there were 2 job
applications explicitly gearing towards new grads; the rest is generic in that everybody can apply for them, forcing
new grads to have the same competitive edge as working professionals.</p>
<p>Despite this, I've also been grateful for the situation that I'm in. With the current competitive and dire market,
a lot of people who are significantly smarter and harder working than me who are not able to find a job in this
economy.
My heart goes out for those people.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, wow, it's been a quick minute since I posted a new article. How's everyone doing :) I'm still trucking
away at life applying to compiler jobs as well as schooling at Berk. Hope everybody's doing great :)</p>
<p>This
article is for
people
who might be
asking:</p>
<p>"Ok, I've read the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a>
series and done its
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">llvm tutorial</a> already.
What's next?"</p>
<p>More specifically, the article is about adding primitive support for error reporting to the
toy compiler. The article assumes some familiarity with lexer, parsing and the visitor pattern. Some familiarity with
the parser and its abstract syntax tree (<a href="https://dev.to/balapriya/abstract-syntax-tree-ast-explained-in-plain-english-1h38" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AST</a>) construction from the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">llvm tutorial</a>
is helpful
but not necessary.</p>
<p>Besides that, the article is also to share my software design decisions regarding my compiler's diagnostics and to
improve my technical writing ability.</p>
<p>As is tradition :) I also wanna share some songs with you. The two songs are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-zubTTp8Tg&#x26;ab_channel=COIN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Valentine</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvG12DVUCNg&#x26;ab_channel=COIN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Into my arms</a>,
both by COIN, one of my fav bands :) To me, Valentine is this flirty and fun—like a rush of butterflies, you know?
It’s got that energetic, dreamy beat that feels like falling in love for the first time. But Into My Arms' this
pure intimacy, deep, and emotional calling. It's as if the singer knows what they really wants and they're just
pulling at the heartstrings and begging
you to just melt
into
someone’s
embrace.</p>
<p>Sigh, at this point you might be thinking I must be writing blogs just to share and review music, huh? :) Smh</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy :) (both the songs and the blog hahah)</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Compiler diagnostics is an important aspect in one's compiler. From erroring out on the programmer's mistake to
providing warnings or giving diagnostics, the ability to accurately locate the location of the pesky problems to said
programmer is proven to be extremely valuable: only providing to the programmer the row and column number of where an error occurs is less helpful and more confusing than a compiler pointing, tracing and explaining an error to a programmer.</p>
<p>The article then discusses a way to improve upon the llvm Kaleidoscope toy compiler in the diagnostic aspect for the
user. The picture below shows the difference between a primitive and a somewhat sophisticated
error
diagnostics scheme and is implemented as
part of
the sammine
compiler.</p>

<p>Let's start with a simple description of the problem and a simple answer to the said problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a string (which is the input of the compiler), and a starting point index and an ending point index of said

<p>Wewwww....
Let's talk about the tokens and the lexer. When given the source code as a string (maybe via a file), the lexer
scans from left to right on that string, each time incrementing the index on the string and returning a token.
Thus, this is the basis of our class Location.</p>
<p>In sammine, tokens are (loosely) modeled as:</p>

<p>After we've produced our tokens, the parser takes in the stream of tokens and produces our ASTs. An AST is created
after identification for a specific ordering of some tokens.</p>
<p>For this newly created AST, the simple thing to do is to combine all the AST's token's location into one. Below shows
pseudocode for that</p>

<p>The scope visitor will, of course, visit different ASTs at play. However, what we're concerned with is how these
orders affect what we want to do, in this case, scope checking. What we want to do next is to declare a few rules
for the scope visitor to register a scope and check for variable shadowing in a scope. Since we have seperated the

<p>That's it from me for now!</p>
<p>Implementing diagnostics for my compiler was really fun. I knew that being able to abstract and reuse code is a
crucial aspect of software engineering, and showcasing this in an actual project is a big deal for me. Different
stages in a compiler needing diagnostics mean that unless I reuse code, repetitive concepts will keep popping up.</p>
<p>There are still features to be desired and to be implemented. One of them is chaining diagnostic locations: figuring
out a clean way to chain together multiple diagnostic would be really helpful for programmers. Another one is
propagating the location info down to LLVM's codegen stage:
this means that we need to somehow conform the <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="cpp" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#ADBAC7">Location</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="Location" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span> class to LLVM's debugging location info class.

not-yet-defined

<h1 id="project"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#project"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Project</h1>
<p>From the gccrs github, "gccrs is a full alternative implementation of the Rust language ontop of GCC with the goal to become fully upstream with the GNU toolchain."</p>
<p>One of the steps to reach its implementation counterpart's parity (rustc) is the support of inline assembly. Enabling this feature allows programmers to work on low level situation where some extra performance is always needed.</p>
<p>An example is where you would want to handle the case of moving 16-bit data when the data is not exactly 64-bit.</p>

<p>The gcc compiler will be able to detect parse the assembly code within asm!, and global_asm! macro, converting them to gcc assembly format to eventually generate code.</p>
<h1 id="goals"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#goals"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Goals</h1>
<p>This work will require modifications to multiple parts of our compiler, with the creation of built-in macro expanders, AST nodes, HIR nodes, as well as the development of a Rust inline-assembly parser to then convert it to the GCC inline assembly format:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a Rust inline assembly parser.</li>
<li>Improve AST inline assembly node.</li>
<li>Construct HIR inline assembly node.</li>
<li>Construct HIR node visitor for the Lowering process.</li>
<li>Implement the HIR -> Generic IL process for inline assembly HIR nodes.</li>
<li>End to test testing of the new gccrs compiler for parity with rustc</li>
</ul>

<p>Since Rust follows a different convention in calling its assembly than C/C++, I need to parse and capture the information so that in later stages, I can use the information as arguments into one of gcc’s available function call regarding inline assembly.
The parser will be a recursive-descent parser, adhering to the ABNF syntax described at <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/inline-assembly.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/inline-assembly.html</a></p>
<p>The programmer (me in this case) will need to learn about gccrs’ token stream API, error emitting api (rust_error?), in order to input tokens and process them.</p>
<p>The tests would consist of different scenarios of token streams from valid rust files and the parser should be able to capture all the necessary information from the token streams. For testing, the programmer should consult <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/manual/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/manual/index.html</a> and look at relevant test suites</p>
<p>One inspiration for this part would be <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_codegen_gcc/src/asm.rs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rustc_codegen_gcc/asm.rs</a> to see how the project translates rust inline assembly to gcc inline assembly IR (IR here represents the result after the parser has finished parsing it and the semantics have been transformed (per the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_codegen_gcc/src/asm.rs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">asm.rs</a> file's comment) and later can be used solely to generate code).</p>
<p>Another one is since rust asm uses formatting with arg, it will be helpful to consider  <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_parse_format/src/lib.rs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_parse_format/src/lib.rs</a> and see how they work with the formatting logic.</p>

<p>Hi everyone, I’m Jasmine. I’m currently a junior undergraduate at UC Berkeley majoring in EECS. This semester, I am taking an undergraduate compiler and will be taking a grad class about code optimization this upcoming Fall.</p>
<p>I’ve been programming in C, C++, Python, Java, Rust, mainly C/C++ and have done projects in relation to C++ and compilers</p>
<p>Regarding compilers,  one of my projects include building a Scheme (Lisp dialect) Interpreter with recursive descent parsing in Python. As a semester-long class project, I am also building a ChocoPy compiler (a statically-typed subset of Python) with Java’s lexer and Java’s LALR(1) parser generator, writing passes for semantic checking and type-checking, as well as generating RISC-V assembly code. I just recently finished the LLVM’s Kaleidoscope tutorial and am trying to refactor the LLVM-based compiler as my own hobby project; currently I have gotten lexing and parsing refactored.</p>
<p>I’ve also done a number of projects related to C/C++. Some includes reimplementing std::vector with the standard allocator. As another semester-long class project, I’m working on PintOS, an educational operating system, adding support for syscalls, multiprocessing and multithreading and file systems.</p>
<h2 id="my-contribution-to-gccrs"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#my-contribution-to-gccrs"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>My contribution to gccrs</h2>
<p>I want to preface this by saying all of this contribution would not be possible if not for my potential mentor Arthur.</p>
<p>I joined gccrs' Zulip channel in late febuary / early March and since have put in some pull requests for the repository as well as contributed an ARM-based Ubuntu Docker image tailored to development of gccrs with persistent storage settings and different hotswappable versions of the image via docker compose at <a href="https://github.com/badumbatish/gccrs-workspace" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/badumbatish/gccrs-workspace</a>.</p>
<p>My first contribution was adding tl::optional typing to MacroBuiltin map, a data structure I need to familiar with for this project.</p>
<p>The second contribution was to refactor all macro handlers into different themes to ease navigation and development.</p>
<p>For the third and fourth one, I fixed a error emitting bug when late-resolving an id expression and fixed visibility storage from parsing ExternalTypeItem until HIR construction.</p>

<h2 id="prologue"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#prologue"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Prologue</h2>
<p>Hi everyone, I hope everybody's been great :) I hope you like my last report for my graduate class <a href="https://badumbatish.github.io/posts/going_to_mlir_gym_1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. This article is also related to the same project. It
discusses the
SSA linear scan
register
allocation algorithm and the steps taken to implement it.</p>
<p>Just like the last MLIR report post, I also include a supporting section (<strong>SS</strong>) right before the introduction for
unfamiliar
reader in the compiler space.</p>
<p>Without reading the SS, I assume interested readers are familiar with some basic middle-end IR concepts (e.g <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϕ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\phi</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">ϕ</span></span></span></span>
notation, liveness analysis, loops).</p>
<p>With reading the SS, there is some context from the last report's <a href="https://badumbatish.github.io/posts/going_to_mlir_gym_1#reader-supporting-section" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SS</a> that I think would be helpful.</p>
<p>And as is tradition, I also wanna share a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HFyoxqUi0g&#x26;ab_channel=CROWONHYENAS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">song</a> for
you to listen to while reading. Initially it was between this song and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW6f7mEXfPQ&#x26;ab_channel=HipHopDXAsia" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that</a> song. What can I say? I guess this is a long form way to say I want you to listen to
both :)</p>
<p>I hope everybody enjoys :)</p>

<p>Dataflow analysis: Abstractly, dataflow analysis is a way to understand how data moves and changes throughout a
computer program.
It helps us track what happens to different values (like variables) as the program runs from start to finish.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaching_definition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reaching definition</a> is
run, the compiler can detect if some variable is possibly uninitialized and warn us if such cases appear:</p>

<li>Loop header: In hand with dominance, a block is said to be a loop header if it dominates one of its
predecessors (a block that points to it). Knowing what a loop header is, and later identifying it would be of great
help in
our live intervals (of our linear register allocator) construction. As in the paper by Wimmer and Franz, their live
intervals construction bypasses the dataflow analysis cost itself, simply on the concept of dominance and loop header.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before heading further, let's look at an example for the two concepts.</p>
<p>In this control flow graph, A dominates every BB, including itself.
B dominates D; even though there is a path from
D to B, it must have first passed from B first. Since B dominates its predecessor, B is a loop header; hence,
there is a loop :)</p>
<p>D is:

<li>Live interval and Live ranges pre-notes: Different papers derive the meaning of a live range differently. For example,
in Engineering a
Compiler 2nd Edition pg. 690, live range is a closed set of pairs of use and def locations. In Mössenböck &#x26;
Pfeiffer, the roughly same definition is dedicated to <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>live intervals</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="live intervals" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span>, leaving the meaning of <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>range</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="range" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span> to just mean

<p>Overall, the concepts were born to ease the job of register allocators. If some variables are not live anymore
(since their definitions), their registers can be reused for another variable instead. In this view, contention for a
register (a scarce resource)
between some variables can instead be seen as the intersection (or lack thereof) between different live ranges. In
this effect, at the register allocation phase, the compiler effective translates the tradition SSA variable naming
scheme into a set of live intervals.</p>
<p>Hopefully, after
reading the two (closely related) definitions and seeing how they're defined to solve the same problem, we've cleared
up the
confusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>Terminologies: in this article, sometimes I refer to SSA variables as mlir::Value. This boils down to the same
concept: a variable that is defined only once (and cannot be changed).</li>

Register allocation is an important aspect in the compiler construction phase.
Registers being the fastest
(but most limited) in the memory hierarchy, the compiler's register allocator must be strategic about this
resource, more usages in registers instead of the stack means reduced latency and
improved execution speed.</p>

generating a lot of virtual registers, there were concerns about it exceeding the limit of <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>16</mn></msup><mo>=</mo><mn>65</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>536</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">2^{16} = 65,536</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8141em;"></span><span class="mord"><span class="mord">2</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.8141em;"><span style="top:-3.063em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight"><span class="mord mtight">16</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8389em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord">65</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">536</span></span></span></span> virtual
registers. In this case, the linear register allocation project helps bring down the number of virtual registers under
the limit (of course they can just run less obfuscation hahahah).</p>
<p>This article then draws the learning mainly from three sources: the text book Engineer a Compiler, and two papers
from Mössenböck &#x26; Pfeiffer <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-45937-5_17.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MP02</a> and Wimmer &#x26; Franz <a href="http://www.christianwimmer.at/Publications/Wimmer10a/Wimmer10a.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">WF10</a>.</p>
<p>Personally, this is also another opportunity for me to improve my compiler arsenal. Some undergraduate compiler
classes leave this part out or only as part of a pen and paper exercise; knowing how to perform register allocation
(and writing about it)
would be a big push in the direction.</p>
<p>All discussed concepts are driven from the links in the resources section.</p>

no mention of MLIR (of course hahaa).</p>

<p>In order for a live range to make sense, we need to know where (or when) does an SSA value start living and where (or when)
does an SSA value ends its life. To do this, we need to number the instruction topologically.</p>
<p>In linear scan register allocation, after we have handled our <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϕ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\phi</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">ϕ</span></span></span></span>s as prescribed above, we then flatten the CFG
into a list of
basic blocks topologically. In a DAG, this reduces to Reverse Post Order traversal, or RPO for short.</p>
<p>The reason for this is todo: numbering the op</p>
<p>In both the MP02 and the
WF10 paper, this is achieved with an ordered list based on the BB's dominance. I should also note here that
ordered (in layperson terms)
means that if
block A arrives before block B, then block B cannot dominate block A.</p>
<p>Since the topological ordering of the graph naturally lends itself to a dominance ordered list, MLIR itself shows

<p>At this point, we've gotten our hands on the block list. But Wimmer and Franz introduce a stronger condition: all
blocks belonging to the same loop must be continuous and that "TODO".</p>
<p>Personally, I think the API provided by MLIR won't
satisfy
the condition; there is a chance that a loop header block might be followed by its exit, non-looping block, and then,
the blocks that belong to the loop body.</p>

<p>Hi there, how has everybody been?</p>
<p>I hope everyone's having a great day, this article is about lifting and lowering DEX instructions in MLIR, utilizing the framework in analysing and optimizing the <a href="https://source.android.com/docs/core/runtime/dalvik-bytecode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DEX</a> format.</p>
<p>The blog is intended as a report submission for <a href="https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Courses/CS265/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CS265</a> <a href="https://github.com/mwillsey/cs265" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. The report focuses more on the high level details. The project also discusses the ease (or uneasiness) of executing the project, meanwhile introducing the benefits of MLIR with its elements in the ecosystem</p>
<p>The report is about 3700 words, or 15 minutes of reading. The editing cut-off is 12PM PST Dec 17th 2024.</p>
<p>I also include a supporting section to recap different terminologies for unfamiliar readers.</p>
<p>Please try out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KhfFjCwFDU&#x26;ab_channel=Mademoiselle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">song</a> while reading, it really soothes the mind. I hope everyone enjoys :)</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>SSA: Static Single Assignment, a form where each variable is assigned exactly once, enabling easier optimization and analysis. This form is enforced in MLIR. We'll see the useful feature of this in the translation section.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Phi (<span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϕ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\phi</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8889em;vertical-align:-0.1944em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal">ϕ</span></span></span></span>): A phi node is an SSA (Static Single Assignment) construct that selects a value based on the control flow predecessor, allowing variables to have multiple incoming definitions at a basic block merge point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block arguments: Equivalent to phi (?!) but in a different form.</p>

<li>
<p>LLVM: used to mean Low level virtual machine, but now is an umbrella term for a collection of modular and reusable compiler and toolchain technologies. Another meaning for LLVM is the subproject LLVM within the LLVM collection. The subproject provides reusable components for code generation, optimization, and analysis, enabling developers to build high-performance, platform-agnostic tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MLIR: stands for Multi-Level Intermediate Representation. A flexible, extensible compiler infrastructure within the LLVM project designed to support multiple levels of abstraction and domain-specific optimizations. It provides a unified framework for building high-performance compilers and tools tailored to diverse hardware and programming models.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DEX: Stands for Dalvik Executable, which is a format used on Android before being replaced by ART, which stands for Android runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MjolnIR: A custom IR for representing DEX instructions built from MLIR's facility. The library's current implementation uses this IR primarily.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>The MLIR project from the LLVM framework provides a framework for building reusable and extensible compiler infrastructure, allowing for a unified handling of different IRs within the same framework.</p>
<p>In the case of the library <a href="https://github.com/Shuriken-Group/Shuriken-Analyzer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shuriken</a> from <a href="https://github.com/Shuriken-Group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shuriken Group</a> for Dalvik Executable (DEX) file analysis, we can leverage the MLIR by extending a somewhat 1-to-1 mapping of DEX to MLIR, the newly created IR (MjolnIR), allowing us to use the much more mature framework for analyzing the binary itself. As DEX is used as a mean for transportation from a server to an android device where it is compiled into ART for installation, being able to optimize the bytecode size of dex allows us to save cost on networking as well as server and android device's storage cost.</p>
<p>In the future, MjolnIR will be used in optimization, obfuscating, deobfuscating the Dalvik Machine Bytecode.</p>
<p>This project (and this blog post) wouldn't be possible without the guidance of Eduardo (Edu) Blázquez González (Fare9), (<a href="https://farena.in/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eduardo</a>), a PhD doctorate and a compiler engineer at Quarkslab in developing, lifting and lowering the IR.
This summer, Edu's the one that reached out to me on twitter to befriend me :) We chatted about compilers and stuff, and later he introduced me to the codebase.
He's been helping me with onboarding the codebase infrastructure, together with emotional support and chatting about life hahahah :)</p>
<p>I am also grateful to <a href="https://www.mwillsey.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Max Willsey</a>, the professor of the compiler graduate class CS265, for allowing me, an undergraduate, to enroll as well as guiding me in the direction of the project.
Throughout the semester, there were some assignments where I fell behind. I know that opportunities are hard to come by and I really took every lesson to heart. I thank you for your advice and your bet for taking me into the class :)</p>
<p>Much work is needed in supporting the full instruction set of DEX as well as optimization of it. The project report will discuss the current work (which is a subset of the DEX instruction set) as well as future work.</p>

<p>In analysing the DEX format, we need to parse the DEX file, construct a CFG (non-MLIR, and non-SSA), and then translate the CFG to MLIR's SSA CFG, apply some analysis, then <em>translate it to smali</em>, and then translate smali to dex (via 3rd party tool).</p>
<p>Smali is the human-readable assembly format for the dalvik virtual machine. Edu's provided us with a good <a href="https://github.com/Shuriken-Group/Shuriken-Analyzer/wiki/smali_documentation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">write-up</a> for smali that I think necessitates a read. Here, I show a small "Hello World" program written in smali that is compiled from java.</p>

<p>The reasoning for this is that smali is an easier output to work with than dex. In dex format, we need to maintain different tables of strings, types, methods and classes in the pre-header before we get to output the actual DEX. To make matters worse, control flow is done via offsets, which disrupts optimization and requires recalculation of offsets.</p>
<p>In smali, all is resolved via text references instead. In such a short amount of time (~ 6 weeks), it's hard to achieve true circular transformation (DEX->MLIR->DEX). I therefore opted for (DEX->MLIR->smali->DEX) first (actually at the time of writing this (Dec 7th 2024), I'm even nervous to see if we can get DEX->MLIR->smali for submission).</p>
<p>With the naming of the MLIR's dialect being MjolnIR, the goal of the project is divided into two fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Achieve the circular transformation of: DEX -> MjolnIR (MLIR) -> Smali.</li>
<li>Survey some analysis/optimization provided by MLIR, using our new IR.</li>
</ul>
<p>In parsing the dex and constructing the CFG, the job was done by Edu prior to me joining the team. There was also an effort in lifting some subset of DEX to MLIR in the <a href="https://github.com/Fare9/KUNAI-static-analyzer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">KUNAI</a> repo by Edu (recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfqOivYdD40&#x26;ab_channel=LLVM" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, my responsibilities in the project are to set up MLIR, port over and maintain the lifting process of DEX, figure out the optimization and lowering aspect.</p>
<p>The diagram shown below details the steps we need to take in the project.</p>

<h3 id="operations"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#operations"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Operations</h3>
<p>MLIR is built from what are known as "Operations," which are used to describe many different levels of abstractions and computations.</p>
<p>Every operation has a unique name, often written in the format dialect.operation_name. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>arith.addi (integer addition in the arith dialect)</li>
<li>func.func (function definition in the func dialect)</li>
</ul>
<p>An operation may contain one or more regions, which in turn contain blocks of other operations. This allows hierarchical nesting, making MLIR very expressive.</p>

<p>Although a simple 1–1 representation, MLIR can feature much more complex hierarchy, as demonstrated below. We, however, rely on the rigid structure we've defined for ourselves to simplify the lifting and lowering processes.</p>
<p>The following diagram showcases MLIR's recursively fluid structure.

<p>In a big picture with operations introduced above, the MLIR Language Reference succinctly says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>MLIR is fundamentally based on a graph-like data structure of nodes, called Operations, and edges, called Values.</p>

<p>Knowing how MLIR's operation and value works plays a crucial role in getting the recompiler working, as lifting, optimizing, and lowering all depend on them. I think therefore, it's also important to look at its textual form.</p>
<p>A pretty full (for our sakes) view of MLIR is shown below:</p>

<p>A special thing for dialects in MLIR is that without a compiler writer's specified instruction to print an IR in textual form, MLIR will faithfully print everything that an operation has to the terminal (auto-generative aspect). This helps me quickly debug implementation issues in the project.</p>

<p>To maintain the build of the project, I opt for CMake, which is both Shuriken's build system and LLVM and MLIR's build system. It's also a build system tool I'm most familiar with in the C++ ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="dialect-reusability-and-extensibility"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#dialect-reusability-and-extensibility"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Dialect reusability and extensibility</h2>
<p>A high selling point of MLIR is the ability to reuse its dialects and the ease of defining new dialects in it. This is no different for our library, with our dialect MjolnIR.</p>
<p>In MLIR, there are multiple ways to define a dialect. You can either opt for MLIR's C++ API way to define it. Even though quick, the downsides of this quickly catch up: tons of boilerplate and scattering codes scatter across different files, which screams "update me" whenever LLVM goes to a new version, introducing breaking changes.</p>
<p>Another way to go is via TableGen, a generic language to maintain records of DSLs in a concise way. Benefits (that are relevant to the project) include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized source of truth: Every aspect of an operation should be in the same localized place. This is true to some extent. Some parts of TableGen syntax regarding MLIR are still a bit hazy to me and require digging through either the MLIR docs or the source code itself for clarification; I think this is expected for any beginners.</li>
<li>Boilerplate removal and auto generation: defining and extending a dialect in TableGen syntax is easier than in C++, due to its cutting down on non-needed aspects when extending and its auto-generative nature.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tutorials/Toy/Ch-2/#op-vs-operation-using-mlir-operations" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a> in the toy tutorial demonstrates this the clearest, I recommend a quick skim for confidence.</p>
<p>Introductory asides, it's clear we opt for the TableGen method instead. I'm also in favor of using TableGen since this is an opportunity to learn about new stuff!</p>
<p>In our library, we reuse two of the built-in dialects: <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="cpp" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#ADBAC7">arith</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="arith" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span>, <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="cpp" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#ADBAC7">cf</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="cf" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span>.

<blockquote>
<p>From this point forward, referring to non-ssa CFG means that it is non-mlir and vice versa (as MLIR requires the SSA form in its CFG).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A special characteristic of DEX is that it utilizes (almost infinite) virtual registers without caring for stack space.
This allows for a seamless construction of the program's CFG from the DEX format.</p>
<p>After constructing the CFG's non-SSA form, we translate it to MLIR's SSA CFG via <a href="https://c9x.me/compile/bib/braun13cc.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Braun's SSA algorithm</a></p>

<p>In writing an optimization pass, MLIR offers a variety of tools for the job.

<p>In writing up this part of the project, the biggest obstacle is surprisingly not about learning the apis of different optimization tools, but actually verifying MLIR's and ourselves' dialect.</p>
<p>For time management, I'm opting for a simple pattern rewriter to remove all nops: the <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="cpp" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span style="color:#F69D50">mlir</span><span style="color:#ADBAC7">::applyPatternsAndFoldGreedily</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="mlir::applyPatternsAndFoldGreedily" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span> pass. Using the pass runs MLIR's verifier on its built-in dialect, triggering a lot of errors on our compiler build. Despite this, fixing this was somewhat straight forward with MLIR's error messages (?!) and documentation on its operations.</p>

<p>For this part (translating), I think what troubles me the most is the fact that, to the best of our knowledge, no project exists to translate from a custom IR to smali. Combined with limited knowledge of both smali and MLIR, the cycle continues itself since not knowing smali well requires me to perform multiple iterations on the custom IR, which suffers again from limited knowledge of MLIR.</p>

<p>The project's progressing at a steady rate right now, with me and Edu's contributing on the MLIR side.</p>
<p>Contentedly, with different priorities both in my life (looking at you "full time recruiting") and in UC Berkeley (looking at you EE16B and EE126), a short timeline of 6 weeks renders the initial goals of the project somewhat incomplete. That is, although lifting and simple analysis of DEX via MLIR is achieved, some work is needed in translating MjolnIR to smali.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I think I should have thought ahead and started the project 4 weeks earlier (1 month into class). More familiarity with the SSA form, SSA construction earlier in the process would have expedited porting the lifter as well as writing up the out-of-ssa translation.</p>
<p>After the semester ends, I'll continue working on the MjolnIR-to-smali translation, besides supporting new DEX feature into MjolnIR and refactoring existing code. Then, some form of dataflow analysis on the new IR is expected.</p>
<p>With this new-found knowledge of MLIR, the next steps would be trying to write <a href="https://github.com/badumbatish/tyoMLIR" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an ML compiler</a> by extending upon MLIR's <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tutorials/Toy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">toy tutorial</a></p>

<p>But why contentedly?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've been wanting to dive deeper into MLIR for a long time. When it was time to choose a project, in the back of my mind, I've had some doubts. But ughh, I want to learn, and I don't care if a project I chose ran into time constraints. It was important for me to learn about an industry's tools as well as put my mind to implement different algorithms I've learned in classes in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>I think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/Vsauce" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VSauce</a>'s supertask's <a href="https://youtu.be/ffUnNaQTfZE?si=7byTONQdK9pP3JnI&#x26;t=1062" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">17:42 to 20:07</a> captures the best the mentality on the project.</p>

<p>A good tutorial read is MLIR's official <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/Tutorials/Toy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">toy tutorial</a>. It helps me familiarize myself with the commandline, different elements in MLIR and different ways to do things, as well as their trade-offs.</p>
<p>Jeremy's <a href="https://github.com/j2kun/mlir-tutorial" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MLIR tutorials</a> brings a fresh change into LLVM's terse style of tutorial, I frequent the sites a lot and recommend if you're trying to learn more about mlir.</p>
<p>MLIR's <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/doxygen/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">doxygen</a> page is much needed for resolving dependency issues as well as correct usage of MLIR's elements. I recommend familiarizing yourself with different operations' and values' method signatures.</p>
<p>MLIR's <a href="https://mlir.llvm.org/docs/LangRef/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LangRef</a> provides a good worldview about its ecosystem for a beginner.</p>
<p>ChatGPT and Claude are also (not really, but kinda) helpful tools in super boosting your learning about MLIR and LLVM's api.</p>

<p>Max Willsey's <a href="https://github.com/mwillsey/cs265/blob/2024-fall/lessons/03-ssa.md" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lesson</a> about SSA form is much needed for the project. I also recommended another introductory perspective into the matter with Engineering a Compiler's chapter 9.3.</p>
<p>A read for <a href="https://c9x.me/compile/bib/braun13cc.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Braun's algorithm</a> is also required.

<p>Twoples is a free online mentoring program for undergrads in math.
Twoples especially aims to provide such mentorship to students from underrepresented groups or non-traditional backgrounds,
as well as to students at non-research oriented colleges and universities.</p>

probabilistic method and wrote an expository paper on it.</p>
<p>Before reading <a href="/blogs/JasmineExpositoryPaper_ProbabilisticMethod.pdf">the paper</a>, please enjoy the following previews of it:</p>
<p>Introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consider the probabilistic method pioneered by the late Paul Erdős. This expository paper then gives a gentler introduction to the topic
of Games and attempts to explain the use of the probabilistic method in this field to the reader. Throughout the paper, Jasmine embeds herself and
her friend Lucy into common games and describes the winning strategy of each individual through diverse usages of the method.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Page 5 out of 16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At some point, we also need to consider Jasmine in the equation. After all, humans are complex creatures with
intelligence capable of adapting to new situations
and manipulating them using knowledge. It would do Jasmine no justice, just allowing her to answer only “Yes” or “No” to Lucy’s mundane queries. Let her make
use of the information around her! And give her a chance to actually compete in
this game too!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Page 12 out of 16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Wait a minute!” - a group of Lucifers (fans of Lucy)
exclaims.
“I want Lucy to win!” - they angrily argue. “A person so beautiful, kind, and
smart deserves to have her own winning play in this game. We are tired of Jasmine
always winning ever since you promoted her to an even playing field.”
And thus, the author of this expository paper rolls her eyes, lets out a subtle
“hmmphh” and is forced to introduce a lemma and a theorem that reveals Lucy’s
winning play.</p>

<p>This article will include the summary of my contribution, where you can find all my filed issues and PRs.</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>This summer I worked on the <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gccrs</a> project, a GCC Front-end for Rust.</p>
<p>gccrs is a project to implement the Rust programming languages from scratch in the GCC codebase in order for rust to be able to be compiled to a wider amount of targets. It currently targets the version 1.49 of Rust and is supported by Open Source Security and Embecosm.</p>
<p>By doing this, it helps with a couple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Targets architecture not available with rustc due to the use of LLVM. (SuperH for example, which powers the Dreamcast!)</li>
<li>Benefit from the existing GCC ecosystem.</li>
<li>Help with acceptance of Rust in the Linux kernel</li>
<li>Help with acceptance of Rust in other fields, where having multiple compilers helps.</li>
<li>Enable building Rust on targets with very old C++ compilers! (Targets with at least GCC version 4.8 (which released March 22, 2013) can build Rust)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="main-contribution-aspects"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#main-contribution-aspects"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Main contribution aspects</h2>
<p>Overall, I contributed in 3 main aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>My main project</strong> - Inline Assembly in rust: I programmed the parser, set up the code infrastructure for TREE IR generation in the backend, along with AST, HIR lowering and typechecking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CI/CD</strong>: I helped maintain and improve the CI/CD pipeline. This includes resolving dependency issues in GitHub Actions, adding support for 32 bit CI and glibc compliance CI.
I also created a docker-compose dev environment for MacOS-based contributors, with all libraries and dependency installed; this helps us bypass MacOS's annoying build and link issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code maintainance/Bug Fixes/Code Review</strong>: I maintained the code base via issues filed by my mentor and other contributors. I also helped fix some minor bugs in IR lowering and typechecking. I also help review some new, simple PRs for contributors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="issues-and-prs"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#issues-and-prs"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Issues and PRs</h2>
<p>Below is all the issues, PRs and commits I've made to the <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gccrs</a> repository, up to Aug 22 2024, after producing this I ended up closing some resolved issues that has been silently addressed in some PRs.</p>

<p>The closed/filed rate is 4/8, which is not high. Through out writing the parser and the backend infra, I realized that there are these little issues that's just easier to just fix and not necessary filed. There is also issues that are discussed via <a href="https://gist.github.com/badumbatish/9823719ef359a58b131220d9d79d2aec" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hackmd notes</a> between me and my mentor that are not necessarily filed via GitHub.</p>

<p>Alright, let's try to understand what I did this summer in greater detail.</p>
<p>This write up will try to avoid lower level, implementation-based details but will let you walk away knowing what I, <a href="https://badumbatish.github.io/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">badumbatish</a> did this summer :)</p>
<p>Although I won't post much code, I'll still provide links to my PRs for interested readers. Inspirations  includes contributors from the rust codebase and gccrs codebase. More specifically, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/asm.rs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">asm.rs</a> from rustc, Arthur, Pierre-Emmanuel and Mahad from gccrs.</p>
<h2 id="purpose"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#purpose"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Purpose</h2>
<p>Assembly are often used by programmers as a precise instrument in case that compiler's high level constructs are too coarse for the programmers' intent. With the advent of inline  assembly, you can do this without having to create a seperate assembly file, maintaining the stackframe, register invariants, juggling different platforms and different calling conventions by yourself, etc...</p>
<p>The purpose of my project is to provide support for inline assembly in gccrs. With respect to Rust's memory safety guarantees as well as the context of assembly languages usages in today's modern era, the project aims to alleviate the complexity from the programmmers while providing precautions and safeguards with unsafe blocks requirements and higher level constructs such as register operands, compared to raw hardware registers.</p>
<h2 id="syntax"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#syntax"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Syntax</h2>
<p>In this section we'll take a look at the syntax of inline assembly, as well as dissecting some examples.</p>
<h3 id="grammar"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#grammar"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Grammar</h3>
<p>The syntax for inline assembly is quite simple. This is taken from the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/inline-assembly.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Rust Reference website</a> :</p>

<h2 id="overall-architecture"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#overall-architecture"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Overall architecture</h2>
<p>In this section we provide common compiler norms, discuss the overall architecture of the project as well as some of the most relevant files to the project.</p>
<p>The end of this section provides a high level graph for readers to visualize the architecture.</p>
<h3 id="definition"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#definition"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Definition</h3>
<p>Before giving an overview of the architecture of the project, it's necessary to give context to common compiler norms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type checking: The process of ensuring that variables and expressions have types that align with the expected types (explicitly or implicitly) defined in the code, preventing type errors.</li>
<li>Name resolution: The process of matching names (such as variables, functions, and types) in the code with their corresponding declarations to ensure correct scoping and accessibility.</li>
<li>Unsafe gating: The mechanism that restricts certain operations (e.g., raw pointer casting, inline assembly) to unsafe blocks, indicating that the programmer takes responsibility for upholding safety guarantees.</li>
<li>AST: Stands for Abstract syntax tree and is used to represent a program or a code snippet. Usually in a compiler, this data structure is the product of a parser. The compiler can then lower this data structure into a different data structure called HIR, which will be defined in the next sentence.</li>
<li>HIR: High Level Intermediate Representation. After AST, the compiler lowers the AST into a different representation. In gccrs, this is where different validations such as type checking, name resolution and unsafe gating happens. The compiler then lower this IR into what's known as GENERIC IL</li>
<li>TREE (GENERIC IL): GENERIC Intermediate Language. gcc's language-independent way of representing different constructs in trees.</li>
<li>GIMPLE: (From gcc:) is a three-address representation derived from GENERIC by breaking down GENERIC expressions into tuples of no more than 3 operands (with some exceptions like function calls).</li>
<li>GCC Backend: where gcc starts to generate archiecture-dependent code.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="architecture"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#architecture"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Architecture</h3>
<p>I haven't talked about how we should handle this. Obviously the plan is to have the compiler recognize the syntax so a parser is required, but what happens after that?</p>
<p>Well, like our cousin (or sibling?) rustc, the gccrs compiler itself has the AST, and then HIR. After that, gccrs converts its HIR into gcc's TREE (GENERIC IL) format. At this stage, gcc handles the conversion from inline assembly tree to gimple and then eventually raw architecture-dependent assembly code via gcc's backend.</p>
<p>We need to also set up other stuff such as inline assembly validation, type checking, name resolution, etc etc. This will be mention in passing as it is relevant to Rust's safety feature.</p>

<h2 id="ast"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#ast"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>AST</h2>
<p>The AST follows the structure that the syntax provides.</p>
<p>At the end of PR <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pull/3060" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">3060</a>, it takes its structure from <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_builtin_macros/src/asm.rs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">asm.rs</a>. It inherits from the ExprWithoutBlock, which inherits from Expr, indicating that an asm! call is an expr.</p>
<p>Here, I give the high level structure of the AST related to inline assembly. In the gccrs codebase, the AST are represented with classes and structs.</p>
<ul>
<li>InlineAsm: this class inherits from ExprWithoutBlock, and contains containers for templated strings, operands, named arguments, register arguments, clobber abi, and options.</li>
<li>TupleTemplateStr: stands for a templated string where we store a location as well as the internet string</li>
<li>InlineAsmOperand: represents an operand in inline assembly, which can be a register operand (class InlineAsmRegOrRegClass) or some non-register operands such as a Sym or a Label.</li>
</ul>
<p>By having a close mapping between the three things: Syntax, AST, and parsing, we lower our mental capacity in implementing them, maintaining a clear mental model if ever in need of debugging.</p>
<h2 id="parser"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#parser"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Parser</h2>
<p>Nice, now let's talk about the parser :)</p>
<p>We'll be writing a simple recursive descent parser as described by our syntax section.</p>
<p>As referenced above in the syntax section, the parser consists of 4 levels, 0 to 3, maintaining a clear and simple mapping between the parser and the syntax:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first level (0), shows the entrance of the parser.</li>
<li>The second level (1) describes the main loop of the parser, where we repeatedly parse all the formatted strings first, then operands then perform AST validation.</li>
<li>The third and fourth level goes into the subcategory of each aspect of the second level and so on: parsing formatted strings means repeatedly parsing <em>a</em> formatted string and parsing options means repeatedly parsing <em>an</em> option, etc etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>The diagram below shows the totality of the parser architecture, where the two greenish block in level 0 represents the starting point and the ending point of the parser.

<p>After we have gotten our AST, the next step is lowering it into HIR.</p>
<p>Since the inline assembly ASTs doesn't undergo much change in structure from AST to HIR, the HIRs representation inherits almost everything from the ASTs structure.</p>
<p>Despite similarity in structure, the HIR lowering is a necessary step in the pipeline where we get to inherit all of gccrs' necessary name resolution, unsafe gating and type checking.</p>

<p>The answer is the visitor pattern, here are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some</a> of <a href="https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the</a> references to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">look into</a> if you're new to this pattern.</p>
<p>In short: The visitor pattern separate algorithms from the objects which they operate on.</p>
<p>In my opinion, this is where the visitor pattern shines the brightest: you only have to worry about your part. Let's get into the nitty gritty.</p>
<p>In the gccrs codebase, more specifically, the visitor class responsible for lowering AST to HIR is of the name <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>ASTLowering*</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="ASTLowering*" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span>.</p>

<p>Let's look at the definition and explore the tree code structures</p>
<p>From the GCC GENERIC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The purpose of GENERIC is simply to provide a language-independent way of representing an entire function in trees... If you can express it with the codes in gcc/tree.def, it’s GENERIC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, we are to obtain a working knowledge of trees and tree codes :)</p>
<p>In the tree.def file, the tree codes are defined with the following structure:</p>

<ul>
<li>name: The symbolic name of the tree node.</li>
<li>string_name: The human-readable string representing the node.</li>
<li>class: A classification for the nodes to follow a specific structure/functionality.</li>
<li>operand_count: The number of fields it takes to make the tree of this type.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's give an example of some of the tree codes we're sure to use:</p>

<p>I'll give a detailed look of the ones that are needed for the project.</p>
<h4 id="tree_list"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#tree_list"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>TREE_LIST</h4>
<p>TREE_LIST is ... just a list of trees... It has a TREE_VALUE, TREE_PURPOSE and TREE_CHAIN.</p>
<p>For the first two values, TREE_VALUE holds the element while TREE_PURPOSE gives a directive to later stages on what to do with this TREE_VALUE. In our tree usage section, we'll see that a tree list of register operands contains a TREE_VALUE of variables and a TREE_PURPOSE of register type, denoting if it's input or output register operands.</p>
<p>The TREE_CHAIN node points to the next element in the tree list, which is also a TREE_LIST.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/blob/master/gcc/tree.cc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gcc/tree.cc</a>, a way to construct a tree list is</p>

<h4 id="string_cst"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#string_cst"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>STRING_CST</h4>
<p>The STRING_CST is a tree constant of string. We'll use this type of TREE in a lot of places. For example, TREE_PURPOSE in the above TREE_LIST often uses some form of STRING_CST as a directive for later stages. We can also use it as a way to encode our unprocessed/templated inline assembly code as STRING_CST.</p>

<h4 id="asm_expr"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#asm_expr"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>ASM_EXPR</h4>
<p>An ASM_EXPR has 5 parameters it needs passing.</p>
<ul>
<li>An ASM_STRING of treecode STRING_CST</li>
<li>An ASM_OUTPUTS of treecode TREE_LIST</li>
<li>An ASM_INPUTS of treecode TREE_LIST</li>
<li>An ASM_CLOBBERS</li>
<li>An ASM_LABELS</li>
</ul>
<p>I omit the last two treecodes simply because the project hasn't had the capacity to explore the clobber and label functionality.</p>
<h3 id="tree-usage"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#tree-usage"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>TREE USAGE</h3>
<p>In constructing the tree representation of our inline assembly, we combine the existing infrastructure as well as our knowledge of tree codes.</p>
<p>More specifically, we rely on existing tree generation of our variables and raw c strings. We build ourselves a list of input and output registers to make up the ASM_EXPR tree.</p>
<p>The process of building our ASM_EXPR is as follow:</p>

<p>Yayyy, we've finally relieved ourselves of code generation responsibilities, leaving the rest to GIMPLE, RTL, and gcc backend. The gccrs compiler can now generate correct instructions using the in and out register operands.</p>
<p>Below shows a few test cases that gccrs can now pass:</p>

<p>Participating in Google Summer of Code for gccrs  (and get paid for it hehe) has been my most gratifying and meaningful experience in software development. I am mentored by Arthur Cohen and Pierre-Emmanuel "PEP" Patry; Arthur helped me with the direction of the project and code reviews while Pierre-Emmanuel provided me with code infrastructure navigation and PR code-reviews, both of which are much needed.</p>
<p>The main struggles for me in this internship is three fold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Around designing the code infrastructure to support inline assembly.</li>
<li>Around constructing new AST/HIR/ Tree IR via inheritance.</li>
<li>In general, navigating around documentation and codebase.</li>
</ul>
<p>There wasn't much in terms of inline assembly related work before the summer of my internship in gccrs. This means that I need also to decide how to
create and structure my code in a way that fits into the codebase itself. At that moment, there was just this fear of not knowing what to do, not knowing what to code.
That's the thing I love about software engineering in general and compiler more specifically.
The concept is akin to create something out of thin air: you made up a class and named it AST, inherited this class from another AST and trust that the visitor
pattern will come to save you once you have also created your made-up parser to produce this made-up AST; and the pattern continues on.
Looking back, I think given the time, I should have done more. Put in more PRs and contribute more test cases; sadly, I’ve let my indecisiveness and fear of the unknown consume me.</p>
<p>Documentation, I've learned, is a some-what of dire thing in the compiler world. I'm now, in retrospect, extra grateful for Arthur when he wrote
up a whole docs detailing each step for me when I attempted a hard PR. Thank you Arthur moah moah moah I love you.</p>
<p>I am taking a graduate course in compiler right now (Compiler optimization) (beaten to a pulp) and will try to get into another graduate compiler class next semester (Implementation of PL) and work in the industry in 2025.</p>

<p>In this blog post, let's try to get a minimal example of LLVM running.</p>
<p>Throughout the blog post, I'll try to help explain what each piece of functions do, as well as connect the dots between the LLVM API calls and the resulting LLVM IR.</p>
<p>We'll get started by installing LLVM, write a CMakeLists.txt to build our code, and create a main.cpp that uses LLVM API to generate

<p>LLVM is a very well-known compiler framework so chances are you wouldn't have to build it from source and just install it from your favorite package manager.</p>

==> Caveats
To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS=&#x22;-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib/c++ -Wl,-rpath,/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib/c++&#x22;

llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run:
  echo &#x27;export PATH=&#x22;/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH&#x22;&#x27; >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS=&#x22;-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib&#x22;
  export CPPFLAGS=&#x22;-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include&#x22;

<p>The official build system language used by LLVM is CMake, and thus that is what the playground introduces.</p>
<p>Make sure you have your <a href="https://cmake.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMake</a> installed and create a CMakeLists.txt file.</p>
<p>Now, by running the following code, CMake will be able to detect your llvm installation (on MacOS) (this is from before)</p>

<p>The third line asks CMake to find LLVM and crash if it can't be found.</p>
<p>We'll use C++17. The <a href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/include.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">include</a> command loads the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/cmake/modules/AddLLVM.cmake" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> AddLLVM.cmake </a> file so we can later use some of its utility function for our executable.</p>

<p>The first header, with the class LLVMContext, is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>... an important class for using LLVM in a threaded context. It (opaquely) owns and manages the core "global" data of LLVM's core infrastructure, including the type and constant uniquing tables.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second one, IRBuilder (Intermediate Representation Builder) is an important class in LLVM</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This provides a uniform API for creating instructions and inserting them into a basic block: either at the end of a BasicBlock, or at a specific iterator location in a block.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This brings us into one of the most important building (basic) blocks (haha see what i did there)</p>
<p>I really think sh4dy's explanation of Modules, BasicBlock is much more succint and helpful than mine, please check out their blog <a href="https://sh4dy.com/2024/07/06/learning_llvm_02/#Introduction" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> here </a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A basic block is a straight-line sequence of instructions with no branches, meaning that execution starts at a single entry point and proceeds sequentially to a single exit point, where it then continues to the next basic block. Basic blocks belong to functions and cannot have jumps into their middle, ensuring that once execution starts, it will proceed through all instructions in the block. The first instruction of a basic block is known as the leader.</p>

<p>Let's walk through what each of these things mean besides LLVMContext.</p>
<p>Twine is "A lightweight data structure for efficiently representing the concatenation of temporary values as strings."
It would entertain readers (for me at least) that this meaning carries over from the dictionary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>twine (noun) (u) : strong string made by twisting together two or more lengths of string</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our use, we name our basic block through this parameter.
Twine also has very nice string-based constructors that allow us to pass a <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>const char*</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="const char*" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span> or a <span data-rehype-pretty-code-figure=""><code data-language="plaintext" data-theme="github-dark-dimmed"><span data-line=""><span>std::string</span></span><button type="button" title="Copy code" aria-label="Copy code" data="std::string" class="rehype-pretty-copy" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.attributes.data.value);this.classList.add(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;);window.setTimeout(() => this.classList.remove(&#x27;rehype-pretty-copied&#x27;), 3000);"><span class="ready"></span><span class="success"></span></button><style>:root {--copy-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 48 48'%3E%3Cpath fill='%23adadad' d='M16.187 9.5H12.25a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75v28.5c0 .967.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h23.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0 1.75-1.75v-28.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75-1.75h-3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063 3h-7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1-4.063-3M31.813 7h3.937A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 40 11.25v28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 35.75 44h-23.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 8 39.75v-28.5A4.25 4.25 0 0 1 12.25 7h3.937a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063-3h7.5a4.25 4.25 0 0 1 4.063 3M18.5 8.25c0 .966.784 1.75 1.75 1.75h7.5a1.75 1.75 0 1 0 0-3.5h-7.5a1.75 1.75 0 0 0-1.75 1.75'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");--success-icon: url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 24 24'%3E%3Cpath fill='%2366ff85' d='M9 16.17L5.53 12.7a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41 1.41l4.18 4.18c.39.39 1.02.39 1.41 0L20.29 7.71a.996.996 0 1 0-1.41-1.41z'/%3E%3C/svg%3E");}pre:has(code) {position: relative;}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy {right: 1px;padding: 0;width: 24px;height: 24px;display: flex;margin-top: 2px;margin-right: 8px;position: absolute;border-radius: 25%;backdrop-filter: blur(3px);& span {width: 100%;aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;}& .ready {background-image: var(--copy-icon);}& .success {display: none; background-image: var(--success-icon);}}&.rehype-pretty-copied {& .success {display: block;} & .ready {display: none;}}pre button.rehype-pretty-copy.rehype-pretty-copied {opacity: 1;& .ready { display: none; }& .success { display: block; }}</style></code></span> in its place.</p>
<p>The last two parameters is related to each other through the insertion position of the newly created basic block.
LLVM documentation mandates:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the Parent parameter is specified, the basic block is automatically inserted at either the end of the function (if InsertBefore is 0), or before the specified basic block.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third one, Module.h, represents either a translation unit or a collection of translation unit, think of it as a representation of a .cpp source file</p>
<p>The last one, Verifier, we'll use after setting up everything to make sure our code is correct.</p>

<p>The first argument we get from *FT .We create our function with external linkage, this means that the function is externally visible. Note that in LLVM IR, if
the function has no linkage keyword, it is implicitly meant that it has external linkage. Implementation-wise, I think it makes sense that
we create the main function with this linkage, it would be crazy there is multiple main function in each source file that can all be run :) But of course,
what <a href="https://github.com/overmighty/i-use-arch-btw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> joy </a> do we have if we limit ourselves.</p>
<p>We have already introduced the last two parameters in this Create() function before. We will name our function with "Main" and this will be associated to the Module "top."
This, like all things, should be reflected when we output our LLVM IR.</p>
<p>Now that we got our basic block, we can use the IRBuilder that we talked about from before to create an instruction that returns 0.
Wrapping the basic block with the builder, we can call methods on it to create instructions.</p>

<p>Since IRBuilder inherits from IRBuilderBase, you can see the avaiable helper methods to create instructions via IRBuilderBase's <a href="https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1IRBuilderBase.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">public member functions</a></p>
<p>As an exercise, see if you can modify so that our main function returns void instead of Int32(0) :)</p>
<p>We then verify our module for error, and then print out the llvm ir for us</p>

<p>It is hard to read LLVM IR since my website hasn't supported LLVM IR yet :( But I'll try to guide you through it.
mcyoung's <a href="https://mcyoung.xyz/2023/08/01/llvm-ir/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">gentle introduction to LLVM IR</a> should be much more in depth than mine. Mine guiding is just to point out the
correspondence between the LLVM API call and the LLVM IR itself.</p>

<p>My adhd brain has been postponing writing about this since forver and the essay has turned into a new material.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Coming out has always been living rent-free in my head forever since I realized that I'm trans.</p>
<p>I was always eager to come out to everyone.
I'm not sure why.
Every person I always told.
Looking back, I was this newly-came-out trans girl who was very anxious and wanted her identity reaffirmed.
I was a closeted baby trans. Coming out was a way for me to get acknowledged.</p>
<p>Getting further a bit into my transition, I was a little bit more recluse. Acknowledging
that I was trans, I was more invested in the discourse around trans issues and discovered how much
transphobia around the world; together with internalized transphobia, I was determined to pursue facial feminization
surgery and voice training to go stealth and to hopefully live my life as a cis woman.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not sure. Things have been changing for me in the past year. Coming to Berkeley and immersing myself in this
accepting environment has made a world of difference for me. I've been starting to express myself more. My trans
friend encouraged me to love myself more.</p>
<p>Andd I don't know. It has been tough to hide myself from coming out to my grandparents.
My family advised me not to come out to my grandparents, and I've been following their advice.
But, it's painstakingly hard to stay in an environment where I would have to voluntarily hide myself to appease the
family's peace. It hurts to not be able to say, "I love your dress, where did you get it" and little things like that.
It
especially hurts to go into boy-mode and be eternalized as a male into family pictures. I can't do it.
The silence is just unbearably deafening; instinctively,
on the last occasion,
I walked out of my family's gathering without saying much of a word.</p>
<p>With the choice of coming out, a difficult dilemma pops inside a majority of trans (fem) people's heads: "Do my family love me
because to them, I am currently a guy, or do they love me because I am their child?"</p>
<p>They say "dont ask a question that youll already know the answer." I'm glad I asked and managed to get a blissful answer from my parents. They accepted me for who I am and gradually working towards
getting used to my new gender representation. More fortunate than other trans fems, I've been allowed to stay with them
and remain on their health insurance for my estrogen and hormone therapy treatment.  From this, I managed to
complete my community college and successfully transferred to UC Berkeley. I am eternally grateful to be their child.
They raised me with such grace and pride.
I love them. They've instilled in me core values about life, and I wouldn't have asked for any alternatives.</p>
<p>But
for my
grandparents? I haven't
managed to
get an answer.</p>
<p>I've also always been afraid of getting hate-crimed and discriminated against. With the current political climate
in the
US, I've been trying to hide my transness, or at least be very discreet about it. But, when I think about
how cool these Twitter and GitHub accounts with the trans flag are thriving
and building things and how much I look up to these figures, it makes me happy and hopeful.</p>
<p>It makes me think about a future where another younger version of Jasmine would read these blogs and think
about how when she grows up, she can also do these things; she no longer feels limited that just because she's trans,
she's somehow disabled by this.</p>
<p>So, with the coming of Pride Month this June, with
the question of being "Would I, Jasmine Tang, come out as trans online?", the answer is "absolutely."</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: It's future Jas here from May 9 2025, it turns out that my grandparents also accepted me :) Happy summer everyone :)</p>24:T3a18,<nav class="toc"><ol class="toc-level toc-level-1"><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#gsoc">GSoc?</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#beginnings">Beginnings</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#progress-and-contribution">Progress and Contribution.</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#asking-questions">Asking questions.</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#writing-proposal">Writing proposal</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#submitting-and-waiting">Submitting and Waiting</a></li></ol></nav><blockquote>
<p>For Mel, I hope you get better :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently got into Google Summer Of Code (GSoc) for the GNU Compiler Collection
(GCC) and my good friend Mel had asked me to share my journey and
experience with her.
I figured maybe I should write a blog and share it with everyone.</p>
<p>This blog is just an overview of my journey.</p>
<h2 id="gsoc"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#gsoc"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>GSoc?</h2>
<p>From my trustee friend Chad Gippity with the prompt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>give me an overview of the google summer of code progrma</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is an annual program sponsored by Google that encourages university students to contribute to open-source projects. It has been running since 2005 and has become a significant event in the open-source community. Here's an overview of the program:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>: The program typically runs during the Northern Hemisphere summer, from May to August, with exact dates varying from year to year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Participants</strong>: GSoC is open to university students who are at least 18 years old at the start of the program. Students from all over the world can participate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Organizations</strong>: Google selects a wide range of open-source organizations to participate as mentors. These organizations can be non-profits, foundations, educational institutions, or other groups that maintain open-source projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Projects</strong>: Each participating organization proposes a set of projects that they would like students to work on. These projects span various domains such as software development, machine learning, data science, web development, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Student Applications</strong>: Students interested in participating in GSoC can browse the list of projects and apply to work on one that interests them. They submit proposals outlining how they would contribute to the project and what they hope to achieve during the program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Selection Process</strong>: The organizations review the applications and select the students they want to work with. Google then allocates slots to each organization based on their size and past participation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Coding Period</strong>: Once selected, students work on their projects over a period of about three months. They are expected to spend around 175-350 hours on their projects over this period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mentorship</strong>: Each student is assigned one or more mentors from the organization to guide them through the project. Mentors provide support, feedback, and help students overcome challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Community Bonding</strong>: Before the coding period officially begins, there is a community bonding period where students get to know their mentors and familiarize themselves with the project's codebase and community practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Midterm and Final Evaluations</strong>: There are two formal evaluations during the program: midterm and final. Students must meet certain criteria and demonstrate progress on their projects to pass these evaluations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Stipends</strong>: Google provides stipends to participating students as a reward for their contributions. The amount of the stipend varies based on the student's location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open Source Contributions</strong>: One of the main goals of GSoC is to encourage students to contribute to open-source software. By the end of the program, students should have made significant contributions to their project and ideally continue their involvement beyond GSoC.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Google Summer of Code is a fantastic opportunity for students to gain real-world experience, contribute to meaningful projects, and engage with the vibrant open-source community. It's a win-win for students, organizations, and the broader open-source ecosystem.</p>

<p>I first heard about GSoc around near the middle of February from my friend Ish. I spent a few days browsing different projects
from different organizations.</p>
<p>Scouting different projects, I then landed on GCC's gccrs's Inline Assembly Support. The project is basically having the compiler
gccrs being able to detect inline assembly and compile that inline assembly from rust to that assembly in code generation.</p>
<p>A code example from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/inline-assembly.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the rust docs</a></p>

<p>The gccrs group uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zulip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Zulip</a> for their communication.</p>
<p>One of the main things about doing open source work is that I need to join and participate,
start to familiarize myself with the codebase. Being able to ask questions, help others, and contribute to the
codebase in any manners is a really big plus and a good step in this direction. Some GSoc organizations refused to
consider any applicant's proposal that hasn't opened any pull requests on their GitHub.</p>
<p>On Feb 23rd, I sent in the first message and got some feedback on what to do.
<img src="/blogs/getting_gsoc_1.png" alt="pic"></p>
<p>Arthur Cohen (one of my soon-to-be mentors (if I can predict the future in Feb hahaahah)) suggests that I try to compile
the <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">repository</a>, run the test cases, and then pick out some good first issues to try
and tackle them.</p>
<h2 id="progress-and-contribution"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#progress-and-contribution"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Progress and Contribution.</h2>
<p>From Feb 27 to the submission deadline of the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GSoc timeline</a>,
I contributed <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs/pulls?q=author%3Abadumbatish+created%3A%3C2024-04-10" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">5</a> pull requests.</p>
<p>Most contributions are easy to medium difficulties. I think the thing to focus on is that you are able to show
your potential mentors and GSoc application readers that you are willing to learn and are able to contribute.</p>
<h2 id="asking-questions"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#asking-questions"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Asking questions.</h2>
<p>I also asked a lot of questions during this time period relating to my projects.
I also ask a lot of follow-up questions after my mentors' answers and also add comments into reviews into different
pull requests from my mentors related to my project.</p>
<p>I also had my notifications on Zulip turned on as well as notifications of Zulip through my gmail so I basically
camped my mentor and whenever he replied to my message I just hopped on my PC and started coding and replied to him again
in one quick succession 💀.</p>
<h2 id="writing-proposal"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#writing-proposal"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Writing proposal</h2>
<p>Every submission to the GSoc app needs to have a <em>proposal</em>, detailing what you need to do each week of the summer if you were accepted.</p>
<p>Some organizations would also like to see how you design and contribute to their codebase.</p>
<p>Prior to submission, Arthur provided me two sample submissions from last year, which is <a href="/blogs/getting_gsoc_sample_1.pdf">here</a> and <a href="/blogs/getting_gsoc_sample_2.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>After reading these submissions to get a feel of the style, I started writing around mid of March to work on my proposal.</p>
<p>One thing I added to my proposal is a design doc, which helps me remember and plan on how to tackle the project once summer comes around.</p>
<h2 id="submitting-and-waiting"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#submitting-and-waiting"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Submitting and Waiting</h2>
<p>After I submitted my <a href="/posts/gsoc_prop">proposal</a> to GSoc, I waited until May 1st when the decisions were out. It was very nerve-wracking
to be waiting for an important decision like this. This year was a very tough year in tech and a lot of rejections and/or
no-replies from companies really put my self-perception of myself and my skills down. I wasn't very confident I would get
accepted despite putting a lot of efforts into both the proposal as well as the pull requests.</p>
<p>But then, it came in the gmail. I was very happy that my project proposal to gccrs is selected. I celebrated it with my family and friends.
My roommate and I went out that day to eat Thai food to celebrate the occasions.</p>
<p>It wasn't just good news; it was a moment that affirmed my resilience and capability,
reminding me that setbacks are only temporary roadblocks on the path to realizing my dreams.</p>
<p>Until next time :)</p>25:T15f7,<nav class="toc"><ol class="toc-level toc-level-1"><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#speed">Speed?</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#how-was-it-to-your-cc">How was it to your CC?</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#mindset">Mindset</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#what-would-you-do-differently">"What would you do differently?"</a></li><li class="toc-item toc-item-h2"><a class="toc-link toc-link-h2" href="#prologue-just-like-how-cs61c-do-it-haha">Prologue (just like how CS61C do it haha)</a></li></ol></nav><h2 id="speed"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#speed"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Speed?</h2>
<p>It was too fast, I think.</p>
<p>I don't actually remember what day I got to Berkeley. I just had a few days off from my summer internship at Fermilab
and was just spending time with my family. I spent a few days visiting my grandparents, talking to my aunts,
reconnecting with my friends and spending time with my family.</p>
<p>My family helped me move up to Berkeley, and then I had to say bye to them :') My mom was crying and my dad, for the first time,
got out of car and hugged me. I think they were (and still are) very proud of me :') My older sister also got me a box of presents,
celebrating my getting into Berkeley, which I think is very sweet :)</p>
<p>It was crazy fast. I blinked for 1 second, and suddenly I went from talking to my friends about how crazy I got into Berkeley
and that "I can't believe we're actually here." to running around to discussions, labs and libraries to study for my midterm.</p>
<p>Here I am, 2 months later, drowning in 3 technicals, 2 DeCals, and some side projects. I think I really moved too fast. I wish
I had slowed myself down a bit.</p>
<h2 id="how-was-it-to-your-cc"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#how-was-it-to-your-cc"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>How was it to your CC?</h2>
<p>I think there's a certain limit that the education at CC can give you. I think I was a bit bitter on why none of my
CS classes at my CC can transfer to Berkeley, but I think I get it now.</p>
<p>The contents at Berkeley (or any top CS school) really move very fast. I came into Berkeley expecting to understand
every lecture and always be on top of homework. But I think things work a bit different at Berkeley.</p>
<p>There's discussions, labs and homeworks. There is also assigned readings (that you should absolutely read before class)
for each day of lecture.</p>
<p>Some classes like CS61C will just have too much content to be covered that you kinda just get
the general idea and philosophy of the knowledge from the professor. You are then expected to follow up by going to
labs, discussions and then doing homework.</p>
<h2 id="mindset"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#mindset"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Mindset</h2>
<p>I think there is something to said about a transfer going through a class at Berkeley for their first time.</p>
<p>For me, the mindset change was very real. I went from being passive to being proactive in my education. Coming from Vietnam
and from my local CC, the homework and questions were simplistically configured in a way that is self-contained
from the lecture where you can just solve for them right away from the hint that they give you.</p>
<p>But at Cal, I was caught off-guard a bit by their new homework style. Things are not that simple, and the homework
are always created to push you forward a bit. They will always require some components that you'd have to come up on
your own to solve it. The instructions will not always be clear; they'll sometimes be a fuzzy, and it's up to you to
experiment and figure it out.</p>
<p>I was struggling figuring out the labs and the homework, just trying to code for all the tests hit green.
Otherwise, it's back to reading the specs and watching lectures.</p>
<p>And somehow, the mindset enabled me to do things, and build things, and to just get out of my own comfort zone.
In CC, I was always trying to apply myself but there just seems to be a mental obstacle between me and my goals. I was sometimes
overthinking things and then ending up either not doing it or totally forgetting about it. Often time, I also gave up...</p>
<p>Now, with the mindset change, I am actually doing things. I am building things, reading the docs, watching tutorials,
and experimenting with things. I am very grateful for these classes that I get to experience.</p>
<p>Need proofs? This website/blog you are reading right now is the product of it :)</p>

<p>I think I would slow down a bit, and relax. It was my first semester and I think if I had stopped for a bit to
ponder and contemplate of my goals and what Berkeley has to offer, I think I would have a much better time taking
my classes and doing my projects.</p>

<p>I am writing this to provide an experience for prospective EECS/CS transfers to Berkeley and for myself, to look back
and see how far I will have come :)</p>

<p>I still remember the first time I am in the FullStack class.</p>
<p>It was a reminiscent feeling for me. I have always been trying to get into
web dev but has never been successful. Everytime I tried it, I always
a roadblock with the html and css and never even got to JavaScript.</p>
<p>I signed up for the class because my dearly supervisor Carol from Fermilab had told me that
she needed a website built. No more, no less. My line of thinking was "hey, if there's
a time to get into web dev again, it is right here, right now."</p>
<p>And there I went...</p>
<h2 id="speeding-up"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#speeding-up"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Speeding up</h2>
<p>It was crazy how fast we were doing it. And when I say crazy, I mean like
the class was 3 unit, and we were introduced to html, css and javascript in like 3 weeks,
and then off we go to build a website. The instructor Sebi would walk us through the slides
and then he would go on these little demos, show-casing these new knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="but"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#but"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>But</h2>
<p>It was fun. For the first time doing web-dev, it was actually enjoyable (hahaha).</p>
<p>I still remembered the first time I started writing my first personal website. It was crazy
how fun it is. I was staying up soo late just to get the colorscheme right and the flex property right.</p>

<h2 id="then"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#then"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Then</h2>
<p>It was great, everyday I was looking forward to building my website again.</p>
<p>But it was hard. The code wasn't actually maintainable. CSS is not the way to go and
pure JSS is too much.</p>
<p>I turned to NextJS and TailwindCSS for comfort :'(</p>
<p>Then it was fun again, I started rebuilding my website with NextJS and TailwindCSS,
eventually deploying it on top of my old personal website. The React-based framework
combined with the utility-based CSS framework meant that I was writing code faster and
easier than ever before, tripling or quadruple my development speed compared to when I
was developing the old website.</p>
<p>Then it suddenly hit me. I was feeling a little down. Seeing my old website being replaced
by a new, more modern website left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>It was weird; I had been associating the old website with something
that would be with me forever. I was bragging it to everyone. To Erica, to Emi,
to Aeriel, to Don, to everyone. I knew then when I was writing the old website that
I would need to turn to a newer tool but it still hurt so much having to say
goodbye to my first little child.</p>
<p>It was sad, I was very sad. But just like in life, saying "goodbye" and let go
might be the wiser choice...</p>
