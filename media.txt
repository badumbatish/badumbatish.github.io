<p>CD Projekt RED is proud to present The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt "Killing Monsters" cinematic trailer to the public for
the first time, offering a thrilling glimpse into the morally ambiguous universe of Geralt of Rivia.
"Killing Monsters" portrays the cruel and gritty world of The Witcher and foreshadows the mature mood of the upcoming story-driven RPG, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The game is scheduled to launch May 19, 2015 and will be available on Xbox One, PC and PlayStation®4.</p>
