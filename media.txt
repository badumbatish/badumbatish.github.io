13:T7ed,<h2 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>From the critically acclaimed creator of Wandering Son and Sweet Blue Flowers, a heart-tugging manga about two busy women who think they've figured out the whole adulting thing...until they fall in love with each other. Ayano, an elementary school teacher in her thirties, stops by a bar one day and meets another woman named Akari. Sparks fly as the two chat, and before the night is over, Ayano even goes in for a kiss. Akari is intrigued but confused...especially when she discovers that Ayano has a husband!
Both Ayano and Akari are about to find out that love doesn’t get any easier, even as you grow older.</p>
<p>"Even though we're adults," it seems that through the manga, life doesn't get easier at all, maybe even more complex.
This manga spawns as my next read after finishing "Good Ending" and "I Love You So Much, I Hate You" (both are featured on
my mediaboxd). Compared to "Good Ending" and "I Love You So Much, I Hate You", this manga shifts the focus
from high school love interest and office love respectively to love at all age. More specifically, it asks:
"What if somebody met somebody new?" Through each chapter, we get to see answers from different characters and scenarios in the manga.</p>
<p>I think one thing that the manga does very well is the expressed introspection for each character. However, I think some
emotions expressed in the manga is a bit muted, not as well done as Good Ending. The love expression between the two main characters
isn't too clear to the "marriage" or "lover" extend (only stops at kissing) and I wish the author has made it a bit more explicit.</p>
<p>All in all, it is a very good slice-of-life, yuri manga about two adults who realized they've fallen for each other. It won't
be a linear, simple, phony story about how once they first meet, they instantly drop everything to just be with each other.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy</p>15:T7ed,<h2 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>

36:Td42,<p>Wow oh wow! It's been a long time since I remembered the movie.</p>
<p>The movie's about a CEO falling in love with the chef. I think it's really cute.
This movie came out in 2017. I think I was in the 10th grade at the time, 16 years old. I watched it (idk when) before I turned
18 :) Now in 2025 I'm introducing it to everyone on my blog hahahaha. I'm almost 24 now, it's been 8 years since then.</p>
<p>I still remember having a crush On Chau Dong Vu, the female main character in the movie. She's so pretty and beautiful with her squinted
eyes and amazing sunshine radiating smile. Her happy emotions were so powerful and mesmerizing. Ahhhh what a beautiful childhood.</p>
<p>I remember back then I was raving on how this movie being a romance movie in a fictional movie. Despite this, Chau
Dong Vu managed to somehow make me "believe" in the movie :) I think that's a really beautiful gift of actors.</p>
<p>The title is not like the English title :)
In vietnamese, it's "Hướng dẫn sử dụng đàn ông," meaning "how to operate/use your man" hahahahaha. I think thats an interesting title :)</p>
<p>I think this is also the first time I shared a romance movie hahahhaha. Ahh what recent heartbreaks can do to you.</p>
<p>I hope everybody enjoys. Just google the title and watch it if you have time.</p>
<p>Alsooo here's an OST from the movie:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMNaErIC5V0&#x26;ab_channel=TingTing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMNaErIC5V0&#x26;ab_channel=TingTing</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eefUmtgcp8&#x26;ab_channel=TingTing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eefUmtgcp8&#x26;ab_channel=TingTing</a></p>
<p>The second song's vietnamese name is "Ngắm hoàng hôn trên quả địa cầu."</p>
<p>A thing I took notice this second time I watched the movie is how different each translated version can be. The English
and the vietnamese subtitles are different in their own ways. In Vietnamese, one's pronoun to another person can
change depending on their romantic interest; in the scene of the market near the end of the movie, the Vietnamese
version really shed a new light on this :) I'm really happy.</p>
<p>I kinda wish I can understand Mandarin well enough now to watch the movie in its original thoughts :) What a
coincidence, I'm also signing up for Mandarin and French class this latter half of 2025 in OC :)</p>
<p>Also if you know Vietnamese, here's a review of the movie :)</p>
<p><a href="https://lynnsalcove.wordpress.com/2017/07/26/review-thich-anhhuong-dan-su-dung-dan-ong-2017/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://lynnsalcove.wordpress.com/2017/07/26/review-thich-anhhuong-dan-su-dung-dan-ong-2017/</a></p>
<p>Also if you're Vietnamese :) have a read at the translated book. I actually went on a rabbit hole, re-watching the
movie
twice
and then came to the book for more :)</p>
<p><a href="https://truyenfull.vision/huong-dan-su-dung-dan-ong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://truyenfull.vision/huong-dan-su-dung-dan-ong/</a></p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from the book's first chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How to operate a guy, first thing first: no matter if he's tall or short, rich or broke, gentle or rough,
muscular or thin, as long as he's willing to accompany you to the end of a journey, he's the best."</p>

3b:T54e,<p>An incredible blog post on Medium by Amanda detailing what I think a lot of trans fem went through in the first few

<p>Link is <a href="https://medium.com/@kemenatan/the-man-in-the-mirror-6a33450d0fdc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'll provide some excerpt:</p>
<ul>
<li>"My doctor is kind as always. I tell her I’m still not sure if I really want to transition full-time and some days
it feels like I’d rather just be a man. Then in practically the same breath,
I ask about switching to estrogen injections and adding progesterone to see if maybe that will give better results.
Y’know, because that’s the kind of thing a man would do."</li>
<li>"At the doctor’s office there’s a little blink of surprise when I check in and the nurse realizes I’m Amanda, and
then another one when a different nurse sees me stand up after calling my name. The reaction is almost imperceptible, but I perceive it."</li>
<li>"In the past year, no cisgender person, aside from my doctor and my therapist, has ever addressed me using female
honorifics or pronouns.
Not once. I am sir and he and man in every interaction of every single day.
Normally I’m fine with that. I know how
I look. But today I made the mistake of getting my hopes up"</li>

4e:Td42,<p>Wow oh wow! It's been a long time since I remembered the movie.</p>
<p>The movie's about a CEO falling in love with the chef. I think it's really cute.
This movie came out in 2017. I think I was in the 10th grade at the time, 16 years old. I watched it (idk when) before I turned
18 :) Now in 2025 I'm introducing it to everyone on my blog hahahaha. I'm almost 24 now, it's been 8 years since then.</p>
<p>I still remember having a crush On Chau Dong Vu, the female main character in the movie. She's so pretty and beautiful with her squinted
eyes and amazing sunshine radiating smile. Her happy emotions were so powerful and mesmerizing. Ahhhh what a beautiful childhood.</p>
<p>I remember back then I was raving on how this movie being a romance movie in a fictional movie. Despite this, Chau
Dong Vu managed to somehow make me "believe" in the movie :) I think that's a really beautiful gift of actors.</p>
<p>The title is not like the English title :)
In vietnamese, it's "Hướng dẫn sử dụng đàn ông," meaning "how to operate/use your man" hahahahaha. I think thats an interesting title :)</p>
<p>I think this is also the first time I shared a romance movie hahahhaha. Ahh what recent heartbreaks can do to you.</p>
<p>I hope everybody enjoys. Just google the title and watch it if you have time.</p>
<p>Alsooo here's an OST from the movie:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMNaErIC5V0&#x26;ab_channel=TingTing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMNaErIC5V0&#x26;ab_channel=TingTing</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eefUmtgcp8&#x26;ab_channel=TingTing" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6eefUmtgcp8&#x26;ab_channel=TingTing</a></p>
<p>The second song's vietnamese name is "Ngắm hoàng hôn trên quả địa cầu."</p>
<p>A thing I took notice this second time I watched the movie is how different each translated version can be. The English
and the vietnamese subtitles are different in their own ways. In Vietnamese, one's pronoun to another person can
change depending on their romantic interest; in the scene of the market near the end of the movie, the Vietnamese
version really shed a new light on this :) I'm really happy.</p>
<p>I kinda wish I can understand Mandarin well enough now to watch the movie in its original thoughts :) What a
coincidence, I'm also signing up for Mandarin and French class this latter half of 2025 in OC :)</p>
<p>Also if you know Vietnamese, here's a review of the movie :)</p>
<p><a href="https://lynnsalcove.wordpress.com/2017/07/26/review-thich-anhhuong-dan-su-dung-dan-ong-2017/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://lynnsalcove.wordpress.com/2017/07/26/review-thich-anhhuong-dan-su-dung-dan-ong-2017/</a></p>
<p>Also if you're Vietnamese :) have a read at the translated book. I actually went on a rabbit hole, re-watching the
movie
twice
and then came to the book for more :)</p>
<p><a href="https://truyenfull.vision/huong-dan-su-dung-dan-ong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://truyenfull.vision/huong-dan-su-dung-dan-ong/</a></p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from the book's first chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"How to operate a guy, first thing first: no matter if he's tall or short, rich or broke, gentle or rough,
muscular or thin, as long as he's willing to accompany you to the end of a journey, he's the best."</p>
