<p>Hey everyone, how everyone's doing? I've been back at my parents' place for a while now, getting ready to start Igalia :)
I'm still doing good hahhaa :) Getting back to OC after being far far away in Berkeley wonderland means that I have to build back
as well as get in touch with old support network. I guess it's just takes a while to get used to.</p>
<p>This article documents what I've learned about the basics of LLVM's code generation process, self-contained in lowering from AST to LLVM-IR only :) More experience and time is needed to venture out further away to write more sophisticated articles. Oh well, maybe after I've been at Igalia for a while hahaha :)</p>
<p>As is tradition, here are three songs for you by Zedd: Papercut, Addicted To A Memory, and Done With Love. All three songs showcase extremely well the emotional depth of a person in and out of love.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy the songs :)</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h2>
<p>Something something about how codegen in llvm is made very easy. bla bla bla talk a bit about your mom hahahhaha</p>
<h2 id="allocation-of-the-stack-and-mem2reg"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#allocation-of-the-stack-and-mem2reg"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Alloca(tion of the stack) and mem2reg</h2>
<p>todo talk about allocation of the stack, first draws out an example of the global var in llvm ir</p>
<h2 id="variables"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#variables"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Variables</h2>
<p>discuss three modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>creation: in var def and the map that keeps it, this done using alloca</li>
<li>modification: in binary op =, this stores to address of alloca</li>
<li>read: this loads from address of alloca.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="control-flow"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#control-flow"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Control flow</h2>
<p>discuss how alloca makes this easier.</p>
<h2 id="functions-and-extern-via-prototypeast"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#functions-and-extern-via-prototypeast"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Functions and Extern (via PrototypeAST)</h2>
<p>todo: talk about a caveat that we need to allocate "alloca" addresses at the start of the function.
todo: relate to how strong the visitor pattern is</p>
<h1 id="epilogue"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#epilogue"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Epilogue</h1>
<p>The article, as you can tell, is directed towards new grads and/or beginners in LLVM. If you've benefited from the article
or if you'd like to support my writing these blogs, please consider <a href="">getting me a red bull</a> :)</p>
<p>I also want to extend my thanks to all the developers that helped contributed to the
Kaleidoscope. Without them, the journey to generate code, as well as the creation of this article, would be
ten-fold harder. I realize that we all stands on the shoulder of the previous generations and of giants and I would like to pay my tribute to them.</p>6:["$","div",null,{"className":"py-12 flex flex-col items-center  justify-items-start mx-auto ","children":[["$","$L2",null,{"href":"/blog","className":"flex justify-center text-4xl","children":["$","h2",null,{"children":"My blog"}]}],["$","article",null,{"className":"p-8 prose pt-0.5 max-w-none w-full lg:w-1/2 md:w-4/6 sm:w-5/6 prose-sky mx-auto","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"flex justify-center text-2xl font-bold ","children":["$","h2",null,{"children":"[ONGOING] Extending Kaleidoscope: Code-gen edition"}]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"flex font-bold","children":"Edit:"}],["$","p",null,{"children":["Hi everyone!
