<p>Hello everyone, how's everybody doing? I'm still chugging away at solving LLVM issues at Igalia :) Fall and winter's
coming soon, and by the time this blog's up, I will be turning a year older. Welp, another year a few
more blogs am i right hahahahhaa.</p>
<p>A few weekends ago, I went up to Thousand Oaks and Malibu beach to visit my friend from Berkeley and then took an Amtrak with a date to
San Diego. Isn't life just beautiful like that? I couldn't have asked for more.</p>
<p>This blog will be detailing my debugging methods since working on LLVM. For the foreseeable future (while the blog
title has [ONGOING]), this blog will be continually updated with new knowledge of mine for any shortcomings as I'm still new to LLVM.</p>
<p>For external reviewers and discussion of this blog and others, you can join the discord server <a href="https://discord.gg/mvdVEqDQxn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> or the discord link in my front page.</p>
<p>For internal reviewers at Igalia, you can also dm me on Matrix, up to your preferences!</p>
<p>As tradition, here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvqfHcgIagI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">song</a> for interested readers :) I hope everyone enjoys :)</p>
<h1 id="introduction"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#introduction"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>Debugging has always been a quintessential tool in a software engineer's toolboxes.</p>
<p>As a piece of software or framework gets more complicated, the flow of a program invariantly gets more complex, which requires software
engineers to careful and methodically investigate an issue/bug instead of blindly following one's instinct.</p>
<p>In this sense, although the article talks about debugging, the article inherently provides a sample of the author's problem-solving toolbox.</p>
<p>I hope this helps junior LLVM developer or low level developer just starting out in their journey!</p>
<p>Welp, let's dig in!</p>
<h1 id="resources"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#resources"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Resources</h1>
<p>In writing the blog, I utilize these resources, including, but not excluding:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h1 id="compiling-and-testing-time"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#compiling-and-testing-time"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Compiling and testing time</h1>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some parts of the section takes inspiration from Nikita Popov's <a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/12/20/how-contribute-llvm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">How to contribute to LLVM</a>
and LLVM's <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Building LLVM with CMake</a>. I highly recommend you take a few minutes to read through them!</p>
<p>Compile time on a big codebase has always been a pain point for programmers. A few seconds here, a few minutes there, and you have wasted
at least half an hour extra waiting to compile the LLVM repository.</p>
<p>Once you hit compile, if you have to wait a while, your mind wanders away to other things and you start to drift away, thinking about other topics.
Point is, the context switching causes you to lose out on your focusing power.</p>
<p>The following subsections then describes how to save time on your compiling and executing. This will reduce your development cycle
and TODO</p>
<p><img src="/blogs/hitchhiker_guide_to_llvm_debugging/compile_meme.png" alt="compile_meme"></p>
<h2 id="release--assertion--debug"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#release--assertion--debug"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>(Release + Assertion) + (Debug)</h2>
<p>A common rule of thumb to have is you build a codebase in Debug mode when you're in development, and then you build it in Release mode
when shipping it out to users. But this is not always the case...</p>
<p>If you're not stepping through the code with the LLDB debugger, chances are the trade-off of being in Debug mode; receiving
accurate stack trace locations and source layout position is not worth it.
Debug mode takes longer to compile and link, test cases with Debug mode are often compiled and ran slower.</p>
<p>Release mode with assertion turned on, on the other hands, compiles and run tests blazingly fast as well as gives good diagnostics.</p>
<p>Therefore, it's very beneficial to have two build modes when contributing to LLVM:</p>
<p>You can set the modes for your build by appending these two options when configuring CMake</p>
<pre><code>Debug            : ... -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ...
Release + Assert : ... -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON ...
</code></pre>
<h2 id="build-your-targetsubproject-only"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#build-your-targetsubproject-only"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Build your target/subproject only</h2>
<p>You can also save on your development time by only building the subproject that are of interests to you.</p>
<p>For example, if you're doing majority webassembly or x86, don't build RISCV on top of it. Some tablegen changes in common between RISCV and WebAssembly
will inevitably trigger compilation on the RISCV target, taking a dozen of seconds to compile. Enabling extra targets will also
enable extra tests for that target.</p>
<p>The flag to include/exclude subprojects is <code>LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD</code></p>
<p>From LLVM:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Semicolon-separated list of targets to build, or all for building all targets. Case-sensitive. Defaults to all. Example: -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;PowerPC".</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The full list, as of March 2023, is: AArch64, AMDGPU, ARM, AVR, BPF, Hexagon, Lanai, LoongArch, Mips, MSP430, NVPTX, PowerPC, RISCV, Sparc, SystemZ, VE, WebAssembly, X86, XCore.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="use-llvm-release-compilers"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#use-llvm-release-compilers"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Use LLVM-release compilers</h2>
<p>If you're using a package manager's <code>clang</code> or a <code>clang</code> that comes with your operating system, chances are you're losing out
on development time.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PGO</a>, <a href="https://research.facebook.com/publications/bolt-a-practical-binary-optimizer-for-data-centers-and-beyond/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">BOLT</a>
and various tips and tricks turned on,
LLVM maintainer and volunteers have been hard at work optimizing the LLVM official release version of clang
to be highly optimized for the LLVM compiler development experiment. How good is it? You can see for yourself with the claim from
the BOLT paper</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For datacenter applications, BOLT achieves up to 7.0% performance speedups on top of profile-guided function reordering and LTO.
For the GCC and Clang compilers, our evaluation shows that BOLT speeds up their binaries by up to 20.4% on top of FDO and LTO,
and up to 52.1% if the binaries are built without FDO and LTO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, for MacOS users, BOLT only comes with Linux x86 and AArch64. However, I'd still recommend downloading your
OS's version of the compiler from LLVM's <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release page</a> as anecdotally, I can
still feel some extra perform when compiling LLVM.</p>
<p>After you've downloaded the LLVM release compiler to a folder, you can use it in your CMake configuration command as follow</p>
<pre><code>-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=$HOME/Developer/igalia/LLVM-20.1.7-macOS-ARM64/bin/clang \
-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$HOME/Developer/igalia/LLVM-20.1.7-macOS-ARM64/bin/clang++
</code></pre>
<p>provided that you download and extract it to a folder of <code>$HOME/Developer/igalia/LLVM-20.1.7-macOS-ARM64</code></p>
<p>Btw, I learned about this through my conversation with David Spicket:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>bdbt: i'm new grad and joining a company as a compiler engineer, would compiling a new, seperate compiler that's BOLT-activated specifically for compiling compiler makes sense?
It will give me a sizable reduction in compile time and allow for faster iteration but i'm not sure if there will be errors when using the special version? any insights would be appreciated</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>David Spicket: At least for Linux x86 and AArch64, LLVM's release archives on GitHub are already BOLT-ed (you can check with objdump -h clang | grep bolt). So if there are potential issues, we're all at risk 🙂
If you want to try BOLT-ing something yourself, <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/bolt/docs/OptimizingClang.md" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/bolt/docs/OptimizingClang.md</a> seems like a good place to start (I've not done this myself).</p>

<h2 id="ccache-ninja-and-lld"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#ccache-ninja-and-lld"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>ccache, ninja and LLD</h2>
<p>Haha, you thought we were done huh. Even on top of all this, we can use extra tools to squeeze out
extra time in our day-to-day work.</p>
<h3 id="ccache"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#ccache"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>ccache</h3>
<p>For increment builds, ccache "speeds up recompilation by caching previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is being done again."</p>
<p>In my use case, when compiling the codebase from different commits (because some branches are opened a few weeks ago and some are opened recently after I have <code>git pull</code> from upstream),
compiling the same <code>build</code> folder would often take a lot of time. This is where ccache comes in.</p>
<p>You can use the LLVM's flag for ccache together with other CMake flags <code>-DLLVM_CCACHE_BUILD=true</code></p>
<h3 id="ninja"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#ninja"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Ninja</h3>
<p>Ninja's a build system thats focused on speed and is designed <code>run builds as fast as possible.</code></p>
<p>From Ninja's wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In essence, Ninja is meant to replace Make, which is slow when performing incremental (or no-op) builds. This can considerably slow down developers working on large projects, such as Google Chrome which compiles 40,000 input files into a single executable. In fact, Google Chrome is a main user and motivation for Ninja. It's also used to build Android (via Makefile translation by Kati), and is used by most developers working on LLVM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can opt to use Ninja when configuring CMake with <code>-GNinja</code> and build your code with another seperate command
<code>ninja -C &#x3C;your_build_folder> &#x3C;your_build_target></code></p>
<p>For example, to build the codebase and test everything:</p>
<pre class="shiki catppuccin-frappe" style="background-color:#303446;color:#c6d0f5" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#8CAAEE;font-style:italic">ninja</span><span style="color:#A6D189"> -C</span><span style="color:#A6D189"> build</span><span style="color:#A6D189"> check-all</span></span></code></pre>
<h3 id="lld"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#lld"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>LLD</h3>
<p>From the LLVM's LLD page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LLD is a linker from the LLVM project that is a drop-in replacement for system linkers and runs much faster than them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, it is so fast that I think it's a necessity to enable this by default when developing LLVM, especially when your
lld executable comes from the LLVM release page that has PGO and BOLT enabled, providing even faster linking time.</p>
<p>As of Monday, August 11, 2025, here is the comparison from the LLVM LLD page, with the percentage difference when compared to the GNU's ld linker:</p>








































<table><thead><tr><th>Program</th><th>Output size</th><th>GNU ld (time)</th><th>GNU gold (time)</th><th>lld (time)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>ffmpeg dbg</td><td>92 MiB</td><td>1.72s, (4.91x)</td><td>1.01s, (2.89x)</td><td>0.35s  (1.00x)</td></tr><tr><td>mysqld dbg</td><td>154 MiB</td><td>8.50s, (12.50x)</td><td>2.68s, (3.94x)</td><td>0.68s  (1.00x)</td></tr><tr><td>clang dbg</td><td>1.67 GiB</td><td>104.03s, (19.70x)</td><td>23.49s, (4.45x)</td><td>5.28s  (1.00x)</td></tr><tr><td>chromium dbg</td><td>1.14 GiB</td><td>209.05s, (12.52x)</td><td>60.82s, (3.64x)</td><td>16.70s  (1.00x)</td></tr></tbody></table>
<p>You can enable the LLD linker with <code>-DLLVM_USE_LINKER=lld</code></p>
<h1 id="grepping"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#grepping"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Grepping</h1>
<p>Well, now all that's out of the way, let's talk about grepping.</p>
<p>Grepping</p>
<p>With such importance, often in the following sections, I will try to provide how grepping integrates with each area.</p>
<h1 id="git-git-blame-and-pull-requests"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#git-git-blame-and-pull-requests"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Git, Git blame and pull requests</h1>
<p>For a beginner in a codebase (even a seasoned programmer),
the ability to obtain more information and context,
extending further than the code sitting in front of them, is extremely helpful.</p>
<p>With git blame: <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame</a></p>
<p>It's also helpful to look up on the internet for the commit's pull requests, either through github or through reviews.llvm.org</p>
<p>for example <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D124685?id=431828#inline-1213666" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://reviews.llvm.org/D124685?id=431828#inline-1213666</a> has a TODO, but without reading the PRs, the TODO would seem very unclear and hazy.</p>
<p>In other words, reading code is the first step, after that, commit messages provides greater additional context on the problems being solved and finally, the pull request
and the reviews.llvm provides opinions and directives.</p>
<p>With trying to explore what's happening for a subproject/subsection in LLVM, you can also utilize grepping in git without going through the github online gui.</p>
<p>Belows shows a picture of me applying git grep to the topic of WebAssembly where theres a mention of either "fold" or "DAG" via this command:</p>
<pre><code>git log --grep='WebAssembly' --grep='fold\|DAG' --all-match
</code></pre>

<p>lldbDataFormatters.py (LDF) is a python script to integrate with LLDB. In LLDB, when you print a specific LLVM data structure
that doesn't have the <code>dump()</code> helper function, things can get a bit messy due to how the debugger's treating the data structure as
a pointer only.</p>
<p>For LLVM-specific data structures, LDF provides helpful pretty printer for DenseMap, DenseSet, StringRef, SmallVector, SmallStrings</p>
<p>To utilize the script, once you fire up LLDB, you can provide LLDB with <span class="shiki catppuccin-frappe" style="background-color:#303446;color:#c6d0f5" tabindex="0"><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#E78284;font-style:italic">command</span><span style="color:#A6D189"> script</span><span style="color:#A6D189"> import</span><span style="color:#A6D189"> PathToScript/lldbDataFormatters.py</span></span></code></span>
where PathToScript is the directory path to LDF.</p>
<p>For example, if you're debugging in <code>llvm-project</code>, which houses the lldbDataFormatters naturally in llvm/utils:</p>
<pre><code>...
(lldb) command script import llvm/utils/lldbDataFormatters.py
...
</code></pre>
<p>Here's a picture showing the before and after importing the formatter script:</p>

<p>Alas, a programmer would not be a programmer if not for their automation. It would be an inconvenience (and a detriment to their productivity)
if a programmer were supposed to remember the script import command and then remember to type it in
every time.</p>
<p>Instead, you can add this to <code>.lldbinit</code> in your home directory and let the computer perform said steps for you:</p>

"llvm-project" in os.getcwd() and lldb.debugger.HandleCommand("command script import llvm/utils/lldbDataFormatters.py")

<h1 id="tablegen"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#tablegen"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>tablegen</h1>
<p>For a short overview on tablegen, the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LLVM tablegen docs</a> cannot be more succint:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TableGen’s purpose is to help a human develop and maintain records of domain-specific information.
... [reducing] the amount of duplication, the chance of error, and [making] it easier to structure domain specific information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.td (tablegen) files are ubiquitous in the LLVM world; if you have contributed to LLVM, chances are you've read a <code>.td</code> file.
If something's wrong with a tablegen, a programmer needs to understand at least the debugging techniques for a tablegen file.</p>
<p>When a .td file is table-generated, it spits out an .inc (<code>include</code>) file in the build folder</p>
<p>TODO: Mention a developer's love hate relationship with tablegen, for example, with Jeremy Kun's perspective on mlir's tablegen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It sounds nice, but I have a love hate relationship with tablegen. I personally find it to be unpleasant to use, primarily because it provides poor diagnostic information when you do things wrong. Today, though, I realize that my part of my frustration came from having the wrong initial mindset around tablegen. I thought, incorrectly, that tablegen was an abstraction layer. That is, I could write my tablegen files, build them, and only think about the parts of the generated code that I needed to implement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, my experience with tablegen in the backend is akin to this:
for certain issues/problems, if you don't use tablegen, then you'll end up writing more code and spend more time/effort maintaining said code.</p>

<p>With version 14.1.1, Ripgrep provides a way to filter out the file type so often times, you can use this to exclusively search for ripgrep.</p>

<h1 id="gitbisect"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#gitbisect"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>gitbisect</h1>
<p>It is quite frustrating that on a big repository, after ~100,000 commits from you and a few thousands contributors, you're asked
to solve a bug that happen on some new releases but not older ones. You say to yourself: "Welp I can't really build the llvm codebase
and run the test case 100,000 times to find the commit that causes the bugs."</p>
<p>Instead, with git-bisect's <code>binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug,</code> you can reduce this down to <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><mi>l</mi><mi>o</mi><msub><mi>g</mi><mn>2</mn></msub><mo stretchy="false">(</mo><mn>100</mn><mo separator="true">,</mo><mn>000</mn><mo stretchy="false">)</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>16.61</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">log_2(100,000) = 16.61</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:1em;vertical-align:-0.25em;"></span><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.01968em;">l</span><span class="mord mathnormal">o</span><span class="mord"><span class="mord mathnormal" style="margin-right:0.03588em;">g</span><span class="msupsub"><span class="vlist-t vlist-t2"><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.3011em;"><span style="top:-2.55em;margin-left:-0.0359em;margin-right:0.05em;"><span class="pstrut" style="height:2.7em;"></span><span class="sizing reset-size6 size3 mtight"><span class="mord mtight">2</span></span></span></span><span class="vlist-s">​</span></span><span class="vlist-r"><span class="vlist" style="height:0.15em;"><span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class="mopen">(</span><span class="mord">100</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.1667em;"></span><span class="mord">000</span><span class="mclose">)</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span><span class="mrel">=</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2778em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.6444em;"></span><span class="mord">16.61</span></span></span></span></p>

<h1 id="llvm-reduce"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#llvm-reduce"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>llvm-reduce</h1>
<p>Often, when a bug fails on a big test case, it is imperative to <code>reduce</code> the test case to a smaller one, so that other people can pinpoint exactly where
exactly the bug occurs.</p>
<p>llvm-reduce works on the programmer telling it what test case execution is <code>interesting.</code> And in a unix fashion, if something returns a non-zero code,
it is considered <code>interesting.</code> We can then blah blah blah</p>
<pre><code>--- BEFORE llvm-reduce
define i64 @stest_f64i64(double %x) {
entry:
  %conv = fptosi double %x to i128
  %0 = icmp slt i128 %conv, 9223372036854775807
