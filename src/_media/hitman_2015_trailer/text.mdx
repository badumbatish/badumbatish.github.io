From @katlegopolelo7800:
> when you realise this trailer is 100x better than both hitman movies released

From @bizzzzle:
> The breathing at the end was the best bit, how fast he regained his normal breathing, shows the ability to kill in an instant.

From @ryanstaiger1712:
> I cannot say how clever it is to use someone’s breathe as the beat for the background music.
And the way it speeds up means he’s getting closer and closer to his targets.
Whoever came up with the idea for this trailer did a phenomenal job

From @ShadowMXify:
> Even with all the jump cuts, the color palette and the framing never lets you mix the situations. That´s how you do an amazing trailer.
