##  Quotes from The Witcher 4:

From @herbieherbs
> Me looking at my PC
My PC: I'm tired boss.



From @SaltyCinder
> I sincerely hope that we get more dangerous Witcher contracts.
Ones where hunting a monster actually makes you feel as if you are chasing down something really dangerous.
Where we could go all out on sniffing out clues, determining
which monsters it could be through a multiple choice mechanic and prepare accordingly.

From @gabthegreat01
```
Getting a reminded of the Witcher 3 trailer at the end there
“W-what are you doing?”
“Killing monsters...”
```
