Wow oh wow! It's been a long time since I remembered the movie.

The movie's about a CEO falling in love with the chef. I think it's really cute.
This movie came out in 2017. I think I was in the 10th grade at the time, 16 years old. I watched it (idk when) before I turned
18 :) Now in 2025 I'm introducing it to everyone on my blog hahahaha. I'm almost 24 now, it's been 8 years since then.

I still remember having a crush On Chau Dong Vu, the female main character in the movie. She's so pretty and beautiful with her squinted
eyes and amazing sunshine radiating smile. Her happy emotions were so powerful and mesmerizing. Ahhhh what a beautiful childhood.

The title is not like the English title :)
In vietnamese, it's "Hướng dẫn sử dụng đàn ông," meaning "how to operate/use your man" hahahahaha. I think thats an interesting title :)

I think this is also the first time I shared a romance movie hahahhaha. Ahh what recent heartbreaks can do to you.

I hope everybody enjoys. Just google the title and watch it if you have time.
