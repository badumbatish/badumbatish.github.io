Wow oh wow! It's been a long time since I remembered the movie.

The movie's about a CEO falling in love with the chef. I think it's really cute.
This movie came out in 2017. I think I was in the 10th grade at the time, 16 years old. I watched it (idk when) before I turned
18 :) Now in 2025 I'm introducing it to everyone on my blog hahahaha. I'm almost 24 now, it's been 8 years since then.

I still remember having a crush On Chau Dong Vu, the female main character in the movie. She's so pretty and beautiful with her squinted
eyes and amazing sunshine radiating smile. Her happy emotions were so powerful and mesmerizing. Ahhhh what a beautiful childhood.

The title is not like the English title :)
In vietnamese, it's "Hướng dẫn sử dụng đàn ông," meaning "how to operate/use your man" hahahahaha. I think thats an interesting title :)

I think this is also the first time I shared a romance movie hahahhaha. Ahh what recent heartbreaks can do to you.

I hope everybody enjoys. Just google the title and watch it if you have time.

Alsooo here's an OST from the movie:

The second song's vietnamese name is "Ngắm hoàng hôn trên quả địa cầu."

A thing I took notice this second time I watched the movie is how different each translated version can be. The English
and the vietnamese subtitles are different in their own ways. In Vietnamese, one's pronoun to another person can
change depending on their romantic interest; in the scene of the market near the end of the movie, the Vietnamese
version really shed a new light on this :) I'm really happy.

I kinda wish I can understand Mandarin well enough now to watch the movie in its original thoughts :) What a
coincidence, I'm also signing up for Mandarin and French class this latter half of 2025 in OC :)

Also if you know Vietnamese, here's a review of the movie :)
