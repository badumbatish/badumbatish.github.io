## Introduction

From the critically acclaimed creator of Wandering Son and Sweet Blue Flowers, a heart-tugging manga about two busy women who think they've figured out the whole adulting thing...until they fall in love with each other. Ayano, an elementary school teacher in her thirties, stops by a bar one day and meets another woman named Akari. Sparks fly as the two chat, and before the night is over, Ayano even goes in for a kiss. Akari is intrigued but confused...especially when she discovers that Ayano has a husband!
Both Ayano and Akari are about to find out that love doesn’t get any easier, even as you grow older.

"Even though we're adults," it seems that through the manga, life doesn't get easier at all, maybe even more complex.
This manga spawns as my next read after finishing "Good Ending" and "I Love You So Much, I Hate You" (both are featured on
my mediaboxd). Compared to "Good Ending" and "I Love You So Much, I Hate You", this manga shifts the focus
from high school love interest and office love respectively to love at all age. More specifically, it asks:
"What if somebody met somebody new?" Through each chapter, we get to see answers from different characters and scenarios in the manga.

I think one thing that the manga does very well is the expressed introspection for each character. However, I think some
emotions expressed in the manga is a bit muted, not as well done as Good Ending. The love expression between the two main characters
isn't too clear to the "marriage" or "lover" extend (only stops at kissing) and I wish the author has made it a bit more explicit.

All in all, it is a very good slice-of-life, yuri manga about two adults who realized they've fallen for each other. It won't
be a linear, simple, phony story about how once they first meet, they instantly drop everything to just be with each other.

I hope you enjoy
