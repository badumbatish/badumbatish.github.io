## Introduction

From MangaDex :)
> Utsumi is your everyday student.
He is also a boy that has always had a strong sense of what is right in the world.
With nothing but innocence and a mind that longs for his
"significant other," Utsumi takes on one of the toughest subjects: love. With the help of the devious and mysterious Kurokawa Yuki,
will Utsumi learn how to be fortunate in the game of love? Only through the ups and downs of real life,
and the assistance of his friends, will Utsumi be able to take a bite out of life and learn just what love is.
