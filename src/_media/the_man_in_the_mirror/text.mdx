An incredible blog post on Medium by Amanda detailing what I think a lot of trans fem went through in the first few
years of transition (Hmm maybe because i went through the same thing hmmm hahaaahh)

Link is [here](https://medium.com/@kemenatan/the-man-in-the-mirror-6a33450d0fdc).

I hope you keep in mind that the article is 2017, not 2025 when this recommendation was published. I also hope you keep
in mind that the Jasmine that first read this article was in 2021, not 2025 when this recommendation was published,
not that there's anything wrong with soul-searching :)

I'll provide some excerpt:
- "My doctor is kind as always. I tell her I’m still not sure if I really want to transition full-time and some days
it feels like I’d rather just be a man. Then in practically the same breath,
I ask about switching to estrogen injections and adding progesterone to see if maybe that will give better results.
Y’know, because that’s the kind of thing a man would do."
- "At the doctor’s office there’s a little blink of surprise when I check in and the nurse realizes I’m Amanda, and
then another one when a different nurse sees me stand up after calling my name. The reaction is almost imperceptible, but I perceive it."
- "In the past year, no cisgender person, aside from my doctor and my therapist, has ever addressed me using female
honorifics or pronouns.
Not once. I am sir and he and man in every interaction of every single day.
Normally I’m fine with that. I know how
I look. But today I made the mistake of getting my hopes up"
