Hi :)

song-rec: about uncertainty and imposter syndrom?


## About PGO and BOLT

The key idea around BOLT is that code layout, meaning how different basic blocks are ordered, is growing more
increasingly important the larger the size of a binary get. Keeping in mind the cache
Talk about PGO through ispike yadiyadi yada.

Then relate it to the current setting in BOLT: servers and their workloads

How does
Main idea is reconstruction of hzz

A cool fact is that all LLVM-distributed copies of clang on github is already BOLT-ed with data from compiling the
LLVM codebase itself (thank you David Spickett on discord). This means that if you're working on the LLVM codebase,
and if you're using clang from LLVM release, you're likely to be ~1.5 times as fast compared to using the standard
non-BOLT version.

> For the GCC and Clang compilers, our evaluation shows that BOLT speeds up their binaries by up to 20.4%
on top of FDO and LTO, and up to 52.1% if the binaries are built without FDO and LTO.
