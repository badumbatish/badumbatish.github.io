## Prologue
Hi everyone, it's Jasmine here again. How's everybody doing? This article is how I think about social issues writing.
It''s a rather short form one compared to other articles I've been writing but still a bit longer than [this one]
(https://badumbatish.github.io/posts/rain_jazz).

As a tradition since the first MLIR gym [article](https://badumbatish.github.io/posts/going_to_mlir_gym_1), let me
recommend to you some music :)

I hope you enjoy :)
