# Prologue

Hello everyone, how's everybody doing? I'm still chugging away at solving LLVM issues at Igalia :) Fall and winter's
coming soon, and by the time this blog's up, I will be turning a year older. Welp, another year a few
more blogs am i right hahahahhaa.

This blog will be detailing my debugging methods since working on LLVM. For the foreseeable future (while the blog
title has [ONGOING]), this blog will be continually updated with new knowledge of mine

# Introduction


lldb has auto repeat on when you press sth then you press return

debugging also comes from lang ref

dump

Loop class has dumpVerbose

RegAlloc class has dumpState


should spawn its own shell so git bisect run is not affected

llvm-reduce


ripgrep `void dump.*\(\) `
