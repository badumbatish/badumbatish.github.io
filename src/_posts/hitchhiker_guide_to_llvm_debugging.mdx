# Prologue
[TODO]: Jasmine you need to make your blog more personable, apparently there's a dude out plaglarising people's blog, despicable

Hello everyone, how's everybody doing? I'm still chugging away at solving LLVM issues at Igalia :) Fall and winter's
coming soon, and by the time this blog's up, I will be turning a year older. Welp, another year a few
more blogs am i right hahahahhaa.

This blog will be detailing my debugging methods since working on LLVM. For the foreseeable future (while the blog
title has [ONGOING]), this blog will be continually updated with new knowledge of mine, given that I'm still new in llvm

# Introduction

# Grepping

Something something grepping is very helpful

# Git blame and pull requests
For a beginner in a codebase (even a seasoned programmer),
the ability to obtain more information and context,
extending further than the code sitting in front of them, is extremely helpful.

With git blame: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame

It's also helpful to look up on the internet for the commit's pull requests, either through github or through reviews.llvm.org

for example https://reviews.llvm.org/D124685?id=431828#inline-1213666 has a TODO, but without reading the PRs, the TODO would seem very unclear and hazy.

In other words, reading code is the first step, after that, commit messages provides greater additional context on the problems being solved and finally, the pull request
and the reviews.llvm provides opinions and directives.
# godbolt, -debug-only, -print-after-all, -print-changed and all that

If you haven't heard of godbolt, think of it as a way for compiler developer to say no to "but but but it works on my machineeee :('
# lldb and debuggers

If

If you've ever heard of gdb (the GNU debugger) from gcc (the GNU compiler collection)
Give motivational thinking about



lldb has auto repeat on when you press sth then you press return

## dump.*

The `dump()` helper function in llvm is basically a pretty printer for

A lot of the time, when you perform
ripgrep `void dump.*\(\) `
Loop class has dumpVerbose

RegAlloc class has dumpState
## llvm/utils/lldbDataFormatters.py

lldbDataFormatters.py (LDF) is a python script to integrate with LLDB. In LLDB, when you print a specific LLVM data structure
 that doesn't have the `dump()` helper function, things can get a bit messy due to how the debugger's treating the data structure as
a pointer only.

With LDF, you can

Load into LLDB with 'command script import llvm/utils/lldbDataFormatters.py'
```
...
(lldb) command script import llvm/utils/lldbDataFormatters.py
...
```
Gives out pretty printer for DenseMap, DenseSet, StringRef, SmallVector, SmallStrings

Here's an picture showing the before and after

## Conditional breakpoints

Personally, I set up a keymap in my neovim so I don't have to type so much. Here's the lua code for the keymap
```lua
local yank_for_conditional_break = function ()
    local path = vim.fn.expand('%:.')
    local line = vim.fn.line('.')
    local word = vim.fn.expand("<cword>")
    local result = 'breakpoint set --file '.. path .. ' --line ' .. line .. ' --condition ' .. '\'' .. word
    vim.fn.setreg('+', result)
end
```

## Watchpoint

TODO: Explain watchpoint


# gitbisect
should spawn its own shell so git bisect run is not affected

# llvm-reduce

Something about being interesting to be able to reduce.

# rsp_bisect.py

rsp file is response file? not sure how relevant this will be or if newcomers will ever use it

# tdiff.py

# llvm-extract

# Reading skills, experience, (or think harder)

Yep yep, you read it right

debugging also comes from lang ref:
for example, if you're creating a new instruction from another instruction, for example: llvm.reduce.and i32 to i1
