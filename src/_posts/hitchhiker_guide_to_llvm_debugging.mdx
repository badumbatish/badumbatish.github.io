# Prologue

Hello everyone, how's everybody doing? I'm still chugging away at solving LLVM issues at Igalia :) Fall and winter's
coming soon, and by the time this blog's up, I will be turning a year older. Welp, another year a few
more blogs am i right hahahahhaa.

A few weekends ago, I went up to Thousand Oaks and Malibu beach to visit my friend from Berkeley and then took an Amtrak with a date to
San Diego. Isn't life just beautiful like that? I couldn't have asked for more.

This blog will be detailing my debugging methods since working on LLVM. For the foreseeable future (while the blog
title has [ONGOING]), this blog will be continually updated with new knowledge of mine for any shortcomings as I'm still new to LLVM.

For external reviewers and discussion of this blog and others, you can join the discord server [here](https://discord.gg/mvdVEqDQxn) or the discord link in my front page.

For internal reviewers at Igalia, you can also dm me on Matrix, up to your preferences!

As tradition, here's a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvqfHcgIagI) for interested readers :) I hope everyone enjoys :)

# Introduction

Debugging has always been a quintessential tool in a software engineer's toolboxes.

As a piece of software or framework gets more complicated, the flow of a program invariantly gets more complex, which requires software
engineers to careful and methodically investigate an issue/bug instead of blindly following one's instinct.

In this sense, although the article talks about debugging, the article inherently provides a sample of the author's problem-solving toolbox.

I hope this helps junior LLVM developer or low level developer just starting out in their journey!

Welp, let's dig in!

# Compiling and execution time

For a programmer working on a big codebase

## (Release + Assertion) and/or (Debug)

Have two build profile

TODO: get the LLVM flags
## Build your target/subproject only

For example, if you're doing majority webassembly or x86, don't build RISCV on top of it. For example, some tablegen changes in RISCV
takes a dozen of seconds to compile. Over the course of a week, if you're working on tablegen over the course of a week, it'll add up
to maybe half an hour or more.

TODO: get the LLVM flags

## LLVM-release compilers

From David Spickett's comment on Discord:
> At least for Linux x86 and AArch64, LLVM's release archives on GitHub are already BOLT-ed (you can check with objdump -h clang | grep bolt). So if there are potential issues, we're all at risk ðŸ™‚
If you want to try BOLT-ing something yourself, https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/bolt/docs/OptimizingClang.md seems like a good place to start (I've not done this myself).

TODO: Show users the link for/on github release
## ccache

You can use the LLVM's flag for ccache

TODO: get the LLVM flags

Also, use this option for ccache

# Grepping

Something something grepping is very helpful

With such importance, often in the following sections, I will try to provide how grepping integrates with each area.
# Git, Git blame and pull requests
For a beginner in a codebase (even a seasoned programmer),
the ability to obtain more information and context,
extending further than the code sitting in front of them, is extremely helpful.

With git blame: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame

It's also helpful to look up on the internet for the commit's pull requests, either through github or through reviews.llvm.org

for example https://reviews.llvm.org/D124685?id=431828#inline-1213666 has a TODO, but without reading the PRs, the TODO would seem very unclear and hazy.

In other words, reading code is the first step, after that, commit messages provides greater additional context on the problems being solved and finally, the pull request
and the reviews.llvm provides opinions and directives.


With trying to explore what's happening for a subproject/subsection in LLVM, you can also utilize grepping in git without going through the github online gui.

Belows shows a picture of me applying git grep to the topic of WebAssembly where theres a mention of either "fold" or "DAG" via this command:
```
git log --grep='WebAssembly' --grep='fold\|DAG' --all-match
```

![showing git grep](/blogs/hitchhiker_guide_to_llvm_debugging/git_grep_wasm_fold_dag.png)

# godbolt, -debug-only, -print-after-all, -print-changed and all that

If you haven't heard of godbolt, think of it as a way for compiler developer to say no to "but but but it works on my machineeee :('

## Inspecting IR changes

TODO: Explain this in a way that's akin to -print-changed

![godbolt_show_opt](/blogs/hitchhiker_guide_to_llvm_debugging/godbolt_show_opt.png)
## Cutting out the noise

## Deep diving into a specific passes

After you've filtered out the specific pass that you think are affecting your


# lldb and debuggers

If

If you've ever heard of gdb (the GNU debugger) from gcc (the GNU compiler collection)
Give motivational thinking about



lldb has auto repeat on when you press sth then you press return

## dump.*

The `dump()` helper function in llvm is basically a pretty printer for

A lot of the time, when you perform
ripgrep `void dump.*\(\) `
Loop class has dumpVerbose

RegAlloc class has dumpState
## llvm/utils/lldbDataFormatters.py

lldbDataFormatters.py (LDF) is a python script to integrate with LLDB. In LLDB, when you print a specific LLVM data structure
 that doesn't have the `dump()` helper function, things can get a bit messy due to how the debugger's treating the data structure as
a pointer only.

For LLVM-specific data structures, LDF provides helpful pretty printer for DenseMap, DenseSet, StringRef, SmallVector, SmallStrings

To utilize the script, once you fire up LLDB, you can provide LLDB with `command script import PathToScript/lldbDataFormatters.py{:bash}`
where PathToScript is the directory path to LDF.

For example, if you're debugging in `llvm-project`, which houses the lldbDataFormatters naturally in llvm/utils:
```
...
(lldb) command script import llvm/utils/lldbDataFormatters.py
...
```

Here's a picture showing the before and after importing the formatter script:

![showcase_lldbformatters](/blogs/hitchhiker_guide_to_llvm_debugging/showcase_lldbDataFormatters.png)

Alas, a programmer would not be a programmer if not for their automation. It would be an inconvenience (and a detriment to their productivity)
if a programmer were supposed to remember the script import command and then remember to type it in
every time.

Instead, you can add this to `.lldbinit` in your home directory and let the computer perform said steps for you:
```
script
"llvm-project" in os.getcwd() and lldb.debugger.HandleCommand("command script import llvm/utils/lldbDataFormatters.py")
```

## Conditional breakpoints

Personally, I set up a keymap in my neovim so I don't have to type so much. Here's the lua code for the keymap
```lua
local yank_for_conditional_break = function ()
    local path = vim.fn.expand('%:.')
    local line = vim.fn.line('.')
    local word = vim.fn.expand("<cword>")
    local result = 'breakpoint set --file '.. path .. ' --line ' .. line .. ' --condition ' .. '\'' .. word
    vim.fn.setreg('+', result)
end
```

# tablegen

For a short overview on tablegen, the [LLVM tablegen docs](https://llvm.org/docs/TableGen/) cannot be more succint:
> TableGenâ€™s purpose is to help a human develop and maintain records of domain-specific information.
... [reducing] the amount of duplication, the chance of error, and [making] it easier to structure domain specific information.

.td (tablegen) files are ubiquitous in the LLVM world; if you have contributed to LLVM, chances are you've read a `.td` file.
If something's wrong with a tablegen, a programmer needs to understand at least the debugging techniques for a tablegen file.

When a .td file is table-generated, it spits out an .inc (`include`) file in the build folder

TODO: Mention a developer's love hate relationship with tablegen, for example, with Jeremy Kun's perspective on mlir's tablegen:

> It sounds nice, but I have a love hate relationship with tablegen. I personally find it to be unpleasant to use, primarily because it provides poor diagnostic information when you do things wrong. Today, though, I realize that my part of my frustration came from having the wrong initial mindset around tablegen. I thought, incorrectly, that tablegen was an abstraction layer. That is, I could write my tablegen files, build them, and only think about the parts of the generated code that I needed to implement.

Personally, my experience with tablegen in the backend is akin to this:
for certain issues/problems, if you don't use tablegen, then you'll end up writing more code and spend more time/effort maintaining said code.

## Grepping tablegen
With version 14.1.1, Ripgrep provides a way to filter out the file type so often times, you can use this to exclusively search for ripgrep.

```
rg --type-add 'td:*.td' -ttd "<What you want to search here" <where you want to search>
```
# gitbisect

It is quite frustrating that on a big repository, after ~100,000 commits from you and a few thousands contributors, you're asked
to solve a bug that happen on some new releases but not older ones. You say to yourself: "Welp I can't really build the llvm codebase
and run the test case 100,000 times to find the commit that causes the bugs."

Instead, with git-bisect's `binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug,` you can reduce this down to $$log_2(100,000) = 16.61$$

should spawn its own shell so git bisect run is not affected

The rest of this gitbisect section focuses on helping you set up a basic script to automate the bug finding process with gitbisect.


# llvm-reduce

Often, when a bug fails on a big test case, it is imperative to `reduce` the test case to a smaller one, so that other people can pinpoint exactly where
exactly the bug occurs.

llvm-reduce works on the programmer telling it what test case execution is `interesting.` And in a unix fashion, if something returns a non-zero code,
it is considered `interesting.` We can then blah blah blah


```
--- BEFORE llvm-reduce
define i64 @stest_f64i64(double %x) {
entry:
  %conv = fptosi double %x to i128
  %0 = icmp slt i128 %conv, 9223372036854775807
  %spec.store.select = select i1 %0, i128 %conv, i128 9223372036854775807
  %1 = icmp sgt i128 %spec.store.select, -9223372036854775808
  %spec.store.select7 = select i1 %1, i128 %spec.store.select, i128 -9223372036854775808
  %conv6 = trunc i128 %spec.store.select7 to i64
  ret i64 %conv6
}

--- AFTER llvm-reduce
define <2 x i128> @stest_f64i64() {
entry:
  %conv = fptosi <2 x double> splat (double 0x7FF8000000000000) to <2 x i128>
  ret <2 x i128> %conv
}
```

# rsp_bisect.py

rsp file is response file? not sure how relevant this will be or if newcomers will ever use it

# llvm-extract

# Reading skills, experience, (or think harder)

Yep yep, you read it right

debugging also comes from lang ref:
for example, if you're creating a new instruction from another instruction, for example: llvm.reduce.and i32 to i1
i
