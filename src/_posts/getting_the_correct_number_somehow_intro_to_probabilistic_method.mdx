## Prologue

Hi everyone, this is a retroactive post about an expository paper I did for [Twoples](https://sites.google.com/view/twoples/home).

Twoples is a free online mentoring program for undergrads in math.
Twoples especially aims to provide such mentorship to students from underrepresented groups or non-traditional backgrounds,
as well as to students at non-research oriented colleges and universities.

I was accepted while being a sophomore at Santiago Canyon College in Orange, CA. With my mentor being Anna Brosowsky, I set on exploring the topics of
probabilistic method and wrote an expository paper on it.

Before reading [the paper](/blogs/JasmineExpositoryPaper_ProbabilisticMethod.pdf), please enjoy the following preview of it:

> Consider the probabilistic method pioneered by the late Paul Erd≈ës. This expository paper then gives a gentler introduction to the topic
of Games and attempts to explain the use of the probabilistic method in this field to the reader. Throughout the paper, Jasmine embeds herself and
her friend Lucy into common games and describes the winning strategy of each individual through diverse usages of the method.
