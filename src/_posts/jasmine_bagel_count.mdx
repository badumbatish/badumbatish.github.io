Hey everyone :) It's Jazzy, the amateur bagel expert here. How's everyone doing? I'm setting up a dedicated website to
keep track of my bagels :)

It's been a while since I've written one of these. This one is with Dee. Ahead of our trip to San Diego, we went to this bagel shop
around 8, and I got
this sausage, egg and cheese bagel :) I don't quite remember what she got hahha. I don't remember a lot of stuff. She said she's afraid I might
have dementia. Woops, hopefully I don't lose my memory too fast.


16:
Around June of this year, I've flown up to San Francisco to visit Emi again before she moves to Boston for her Master at Harvard.
I'm very proud of her :) This is just a plain bagel with cream cheese, eaten at her place :) But there's something homey and familiar that
I can't quite place my finger on. Must have been me missing my bestie when writing this :)

15:
A lot has changed since the last bagel. I signed my offer letter for Igalia, I finally got my US citizenship hehe,
my family's also coming up for the commencement, I'm really happy.
 Ahhh it's truely a leap from #14 to #15 :) This bagel again is the good'ol Honey Almond Cream
Cheese
Bagel,
I got it while on my way to the citizenship interview.
Monday, May 19 2025.

13 and 14:
They say that by looking at somebody's bagel history, you can learn a lot about the person. Well, maybe it's only me that say that :)
#13 - honey almond cream cheese bagel and #14 - strawberry cream cheese bagel, and possibly all the bagels before this, speaks to how I'm a
creature of comfort :) Bagel street cafe is good and it's easy to order :) I like it for that. But I can't help but wonder once I get back
to Orange County, what will be my next bagel.

11 and 12:
This time I did two bagels with mozarella cheese and normal cream cheese. I was feeling really stressed out with
my cs174 grades being so bad and cs170 midterm exam happening today. If #10 talks about the contention between two
different flavors to be the dominating one then #11 and 12 disappointingly showcase why you don't do a slide of
cheese on top of the normal cream cheese: it nulls out the whole bagel (because nobody's competing to be the main
flavor)
 and it makes the whole thing unmemorable.
I did try to carve out some bread in the two bagels out (per #7 and #8) and I think it really helps them taste less
full. Will try
again. My oven skill is not too good to have the bagels be crunchy yet but I'm improving it every day.
Emi is
still sick lol.

10: Emi is sick today. And for some reason I wanted to go to Bagel Street Cafe for a bagel again. And then it's
time for
ding ding ding you guessed it, a red bull :) I've been trying to study more so I just buy a red bull every time
to reward (and trick) myself to study. It's a honey almond cream cheese with blueberry bagel this time. The flavor is a
bit weird
this time. When I bite into the bagel, it feels like the blueberry and the honey almond is fighting with each other
to see who gets to be the main dominating flavor. Wed, Apr 2, 2025. 5/10 rating

9: When on a walk/date with Lorem Ipsum , we got bagel at Bagel Street Cafe. I always come back to my familiar spots and
bagels' no different. This time its a "Poppy Seed Bagel Honey Almond Cream Cheese". 8/10 again. It's a solid
experience :) The poppy seed this time makes it interesting :) I'm glad i got Lorem to enjoy it with me. She was
really guiding the question since I had stayed up 2am yesterday and couldn't sleep much. I felt bad hahah.

7 and 8: I woke up at 9:30AM today after falling asleep at 8PM yesterday. I woke up, drank some non-redbull energy
drink and ate two basic cream cheese again at my place. I didn't put enough cream cheese again, I'm not sure why but
it always felt like there's more bread than there are cream cheese. Next time I'll hollow out the bagels a little
bit so I'm not chewing on so much bread. Sun march 16 2025. 5/10 this time hahaha, much improvement over the 4th and
5th
bagel.

6: with Emi and Noah at their place in SF :) A bagel with raisins and cream cheese, its really good :) I like
hanging out with them. Sat mar 15 2025. 8/10 hahah :)


4 and 5: at home cream cheese in anchor house haha :) just stuffing my place with bagels. I didn't put enough cream
cheese :( :( :(. I gotta rate myself 4 out of 10 for this.


3.With Julia and Sherry: A bagel with honey almond flavored cream cheese at Bagel street coffee. March 11 2025. I
like the sweetness, but couldn't taste any almond. 8.5/10, really good, no almod.


2: with Josh. A flavored cream cheese bagel: sun dried tomato. Bagel street caffe. Pretty good, not too sweet not
too salty, really nice. sat, march 8, 2025. 7/10, couldn't taste the sun dried tomato

1: with Emi and Noah at a shop near their place. Just a basic cream cheese. saturday. sat mar 1 2025. I rate this
out 10/10 just because it's the first time I tasted it, and it's with Emi and Noah.
