## Prologue
Hey everybody, I'm trying to improve my writing and interpersonal skills so the style in this article will be
somewhat new :) It'll feel even more like a conversation. Hope everybody enjoys.


## Content

Ahh, I'm finally graduating. And the worst thing is I'm not feeling anything; I feel empty. And feeling empty
makes me feel sad. [TODO: add more stuff here about dilemma and irony]. [TODO, starts with "Isn't it ironic"]

I've looked through Perplexity and then Reddit. The former attributed the symptoms to mild depression, citing high
depression rate amongst Ph.D and Masters students. The latter, from the thoughts of all CS Grads that had come
before me, also confirms the same thing: CS grads suffer from intense academic curriculum, family responsibilities,
internships, post-grad employment and a variety of other things, one on top of another.


Personally, I've suffered from quite a few mental scares as well. The stress of all the aforementioned causes really got to me when I was in Berkeley.
I'm grateful to be able to adopt non-harmful
coping mechanisms and to have a great support system for me to lean on during hard times at Berkeley. Some people
are not as fortunate.

UC Berkeley, specifically, holds its annual campus memorial "recognizing those in the campus community who died,
including, academic & faculty, emeriti, staff, students, post-doctorates, and visiting scholars" every year on
September 15th.


[The Stigma of Speaking Up]
Mental health is a touchy subject. Would it sway readers away and discredit myself if I talk about it? Maybe.
But if I don't talk about it, who will? The current climate of the world's happening too fast for anyone to take a
good look at how they're doing mental-wise and how to fix it. UHS
