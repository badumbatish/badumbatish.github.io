# Introduction

Hello everyone, it's been one blog away since my last blog that's not about compilers. In this post, I want to talk about
a neovim plugin that I've made that have significantly improved my workflow productivity: BRT.nvim. Let's dive in :)

As always, here's this blog's music.

# BRT
BRT stands for build, run and test and the plugin's description on github is "Build, run, and test your projects with 3 keystrokes."
The motivation for building this is that when I'm programming, I'm invoking the build, run and test commands quite often;
I often alternate between the file in neovim that I'm coding and the terminal for invoking the commands
and reading command stdout and stderr, leading to quite inefficient processes.

The vision I have for BRT is that I would want to shorten the development cycle: "run the usual command as effortless as possible"
and to reduce the mental cognitive load from switching between the development file I'm in and the terminal.

Overtime, I've also identified that when the command spits out an error including the location of a file,
it would take a few of my brain power to find the line dictating the file, and then i also have to
remember which line number the error is on, and then I copy the faulty file name to my clipboard, and then
go back to neovim to find and open the file and then jump to the line number to see what the code on that line is, and then go back
to the terminal to read the error message for that line.
Now, imagine if the command spits out 4 or 5 such error locations, you can start to see why it's getting really messy really fast.

Fortunately, some amazing people has already done the hard part, and some quick glue, we can have ourselves a tool to handle
all the shortcomings of the current development cycle.

# Components
Now, building an atuin from pure scratch is going to be quite a task; what we'll be doing is offload some of that capabilities to

# Features
## BRTLog

When the user input a file, we would like to append `2>&1 | tee` at the end of the command to allow us to store the output as well for future revisions (which would be
made clear soon).
## Last command based on type
Of course, we can't always accommodate the request that every command that the user want to execute in 3 keystrokes. What the description
really meant is that when the user has already typed in and ran the command to succession, we would like the re-invocation of said command to take only 3 keystrokes.
With `<leader>b` being 2 keystrokes3 already, we would want (most of the time) the last

## Fuzzy finding


## Customizability
## Quickfix file

It's hard to describe the amazing utilities the quickfix list can do, but for a taste, here is an excerpt from vim docs:
> Vim has a special mode to speedup the edit-compile-edit cycle.  This is
inspired by the quickfix option of the Manx's Aztec C compiler on the Amiga.
The idea is to save the error messages from the compiler in a file and use Vim
to jump to the errors one by one.  You can examine each problem and fix it,
without having to remember all the error messages.


# Shortcomings

There are some shortcomings to be addressed.
