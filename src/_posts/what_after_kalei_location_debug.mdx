## Prologue
Hi everyone, wow, it's been a quick minute since I posted a new article. How's everyone doing :) I'm still trucking
away at life applying to compiler jobs as well as schooling at Berk. Hope everybody's doing great :)

This
article is for
people
who might be
asking:

"Ok, I've done the [llvm tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html) already.
What's next?"

More specifically, the article is about adding primitive support for error reporting to the
toy compiler. The article assumes some familiarity with lexer, parsing and the visitor pattern. Some familiarity with
the parser and its abstract syntax tree (AST) construction from the [llvm tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html)
is helpful
but not necessary.

Besides that, the article is also to share my software design decisions regarding my compiler's diagnostics and to
improve my technical writing ability.

As is tradition :) I also wanna share some songs with you. The two songs are [Valentine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-zubTTp8Tg&ab_channel=COIN) and [Into my arms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvG12DVUCNg&ab_channel=COIN),
both by COIN, one of my fav bands :) To me, Valentine is this flirty and fun—like a rush of butterflies, you know?
It’s got that energetic, dreamy beat that feels like falling in love for the first time. But Into My Arms' this
pure intimacy, deep, and emotional calling. It's as if the singer knows what they really wants and they're just
pulling at the heartstrings and begging
you to just melt
into
someone’s
embrace.

Sigh, at this point you might be thinking I must be writing blogs just to share and review music, huh? :) Smh

I hope you enjoy :) (both the songs and the blog hahah)
## Introduction

Compiler diagnostics is an important aspect in one's compiler. From erroring out on the programmer's mistake to
providing warnings or giving diagnostics, the ability to accurately locate the location of the pesky problems to said
programmer is proven to be extremely valuable: only providing to the programmer the row and column number of where an error occurs is less helpful and more confusing than a compiler pointing, tracing and explaining an error to a programmer.

The article then discusses a way to improve upon the llvm Kaleidoscope toy compiler in the diagnostic aspect for the
user. The picture below shows the difference between a primitive and a somewhat sophisticated
error
diagnostics scheme and is are
implemented as
part of
the sammine
compiler.

## Location, Reporter, Locator and Reporter

Let's start with a simple description of the problem and a simple answer to the said problem.

> Given a string (which is the input of the compiler), and a starting point index and an ending point index of said
string, indicating the component (either a token or a subpart of some AST) that is faulty.

Below shows a string of a `variable definition {:cpp}` and its corresponding starting and ending point in
the input
string.

```
start of decl
|       end of decl
|       |
↓       ↓
01234556789
let x = 1;\eof
```

Here, the starting point for the let expr has index 0 in
the string, and the ending point for the let expr has index 7 in the string (the semicolon at 8 is not counted).

From first principles, how can a compiler consolidate the location of these tokens: `let{:cpp}`, `x{:cpp}`, `={:cpp}`, `1{:cpp}`
together and understand that the declaration spans from 0 to 7?

Let us define the class `Location{:cpp}`, `Reportee{:cpp}`
and `Reporter{:cpp}` currently implemented as part of the compiler and see how all of these building blocks fit in together.

#### The Location class

The `Location{:cpp}` class is basically two indices, indicating the location of a construct in the
input string. The first index
`source_start{:cpp}`
signifies the
starting location of a component and vice versa for `source_end{:cpp}`. If a construct in the compiler (a token or an AST)
only occupies a single space, then `source_start{:cpp}` == `source_end{:cpp}`.

When two `Location{:cpp}`s come together to form one singular `Location{:cpp}`, we take the minimum of all
`source_start{:cpp}` and the maximum of all the `source_end{:cpp}`. This is implemented as the pipe operator `|{:cpp}` for the class:

```cpp
// Combine two locations
Location operator|(const Location &other) const {
    Location result;
    result.source_start = std::min(source_start, other.source_start);
    result.source_end = std::max(source_end, other.source_end);
    return result;
}

void operator|=(const Location &other) {
    source_start = std::min(source_start, other.source_start);
    source_end = std::max(source_end, other.source_end);
}
```

Let's look at an example, given the string of a binary expression `x+y{:cpp}`, since `x{:cpp}` takes the `Location(0,0){:cpp}`, `y{:cpp}`
takes the `Location(2,2){:cpp}`. The location for the resulting binary expression is `Location(min(0,2), max(0,2)) =
Location(0, 2){:cpp}`.

Another thing to notice is that the Location class offers modifiers on `source_end{:cpp}`, this is mostly useful in the
case of lexing different token such as `+{:cpp}` and `+={:cpp}` - often in sammine I have to backtrack and thus this is really
helpful.
#### The Reportee class

Given a location, we need a message to be associated with it, together with the diagnostic kind: Is this message an
error? Is it a warning? Is this just to provide the programmer/compiler writer with some extra information for an
informed decision?

The class that takes care of this is the `Reportee{:cpp}` class. It defines different `ReportKind{:cpp}` such as `error{:cpp}`,
`warn{:cpp}` or `diag{:cpp}` for error, warning or diagnostics respectively. It also provides abstraction such as `add_error(){:cpp}`,
`add_warn(){:cpp}` or `add_diag{:cpp}` for said `ReportKind`s. The input to these `add_*(){:cpp}` call is a `Report{:cpp}` type, which is
just a tuple of `ReportKind, Location, std::string`.

Who's calling `add_error(){:cpp}` and `add_warn()`? Whichever phase the compiler needs to communicate with the programmer
about, that phase will inherit from this `Reportee{:cpp}` class and use these utilities functions. The sections on Lexer and
Parser will go over these finer details.

Besides this, the `Reportee{:cpp}` class also carries `size_t{:cpp}` of `error_count`, `warn_count{:cpp}` and
`diag_count{:cpp}` to be used as statistics for the `Reporter{:cpp}` class, which is the topic of our next subsection.

#### The Reporter class

You must be wondering, just the linear `(source_start, source_end){:cpp}{:cpp}` indices is not enough, this result is just
the
bare
minimum.
Somehow the compiler needs to be able to map a location of `
(source_start, source_end){:cpp}` to the starting and ending rows and columns for easier visualization. The compiler also
needs to 'report' messages coming from different stages such as lexing, parsing or type checking. Keeping these
details in mind, let's look at the `Reporter{:cpp}` class, who's in charge of these functionalities.

The `Reporter{:cpp}` class is in charge taking a `Report{:cpp}`, which again is just a tuple of `ReportKind,
Location, std::string{:cpp}` and print the message via stderr to the programmer.

It needs to know that for a `ReportKind{:cpp}`, which color should be printed. If the Location is of `Location(a, b){:cpp}`, how
does the `Reporter{:cpp}` class transform this to rows and columns? What if we also want some lines of code before and
after the concerning line of code for more context, how would the `Reporter{:cpp}` do that?
Maybe if the `Location{:cpp}` needed to be
reported is one,
or two,
or
three lines only, and it'd be very helpful to hone in and point out the mistake for the programmer. Let


#### The Locator class

### Inferring to rows and columns
## Tokens (and the lexer)

Let's talk about the tokens and the lexer. When given the source code as a string (maybe via a file), the lexer
scans from left to right on that string, each time updating the index on that input string and returning a token.
Thus, this is the basis of our class Location.

In sammine, tokens are (loosely) modeled as:
```cpp
class Token {
public:
    TokenType type;
    std::string lexeme;
    Location location;
    Token(TokenType type, std::string lexeme, Location location)
      : type(type), lexeme(std::move(lexeme)), location(location) {}
};
```

and for the lexer:
```cpp
class Lexer : public sammine_util::Reportee {
private:
    sammine_util::Location location;
    std::vector<Token> tokStream;
    ...
```

One thing to note is after we've recognized a token together with its `Location{:cpp}`, we update the Location of the
Lexer via `update_location(){:cpp}`.
```cpp
void Lexer::updateLocation() {
    location = sammine_util::Location(location.source_end, location.source_end);
}
```

The reasoning for this is that if we don't do this, then in the following example, the
token `+={:cpp}` as well as the token `b{:cpp}` will have inaccurate locations, spanning from the start of the input to the
current index.

```
Location a: (0, 0)
| Location +=: (0, 3)
| |  Location b: (0, 5)
↓ ↓  ↓
012345
a += b
```


## AST nodes (and the parser)
After we've produced our tokens, the parser takes in the stream of tokens and produces our ASTs. An AST is created
after identification for a specific ordering of some tokens.

For this newly created AST, the simple thing to do is to combine all the AST's token's location into one. Below shows
pseudocode for that

```cpp
AST_construct(Token tok1, Token tok2, ...) {
    ...
    AST.Location = first token location of AST
    For all tokens T that made up the AST:
        AST.Location |= T.location
    ...
}
```

In AST construction, we follow quite literally what the parser is parsing, for the following example: there is an
AST of function with an AST
of expr being nested in it,
```
fn f(x : f64) {
    let y = 0;
}
```

The code block then translates to this pseudocode c++ structure:

```cpp
class AST_Func { // this stands for fn f
    std::string func_name // stands for the name `f`
    std::vector<AST_TypedVar> function_arguments // this stands for `x : 64`
    AST_Block function_block {
        std::vector<AST::Expr> statements // this stands for a singular `let y = 0;`
    }
}
```


## Study case: scope checking visitor

Knowing how a `Location{:cpp}` plays out in a `lexer{:cpp}`'s token and `parser{:cpp}`'s AST is helpful, but so what? Operations on the
AST such as scope checking or type checking also needs reporting on where a programmer went wrong, the responsibility
is
not just within the lexer
and the parser.

In this case, let's see how we
can use
`Location{:cpp}` to inform our programmers of some scope problem.

In `sammine{:cpp}`, given a function, the compiler should error out if an unknown variable is referenced or if
a variable is defined twice (the language prevents shadowing variable).

Given the following code:
```cpp
fn f(x : f64) {
    let x = 0;
    ...
}
```
the compiler should error out since we don't allow shadowing of a variable:

To do this, we set up an AST visitor first, where each kind of visitor visits an outlying AST `out{:cpp}` first, perform
something (walk) on that AST ([preorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Pre-order_implementation)), then
visit its children AST, and then comes back and perform another action (walk) on the
AST `out{:cpp}` ([postorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal#Post-order_implementation)).

For paraphrasing purposes, on how to [set up
the AST visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern#Java_example), we
separate the step between visiting an AST and performing the pre- and post-ordering operation on said AST.

The action of perform the pre- and post-ordering operation on an AST is called walking and is implemented as
`pre_order_walk{:cpp}` and `post_order_walk{:cpp}`.

Without specified otherwise, readers (and programmers) can assume that this is the execution ordering for a visitor:

```
Visit(AST):
    pre_order_walk(ast)
    ~ recursively visit each element (sub AST) in the AST ~
    post_order_walk(ast)
```

Following the assumption that a visit to AST will ultimately and recursively visit each element of the AST as well,
the following sections on scope checking
will only discuss the `pre_order_walk(){:cpp}` and the `post_order_walk(){:cpp}`
### class Lexical Scope

The Lexical Scope class stores information about variable declarations and can be used to query whether a certain
variable (represented by a string) existed in a scope or not.

For example, in a function `f{:cpp}`, if we haven't defined a variable `x{:cpp}` but we're using it, it is considered
illegal in
`sammine{:cpp}` .

To do this, the scope class consists of a mapping `symbol_to_loc{:cpp}` between symbols to locations as well as a
reference to
the parent
scope (just in case we want to implement some kind of lambda).

The reason to have a mapping between symbols and locations is when we have a clash of symbol, we can error out and
report on the location that is registered for the clashed symbol.
### Visiting

The scope visitor will, of course, visit different ASTs at play. However, what we're concerned with is how these
orders affect what we want to do, in this case, scope checking. What we want to do next is to declare a few rules
for the scope visitor to register a scope and check for variable shadowing in a scope. Since we have seperated the
pattern into the visit step and the walk step.

- `pre_order_walk(FunctionAST){:cpp}`: We push a newly created scope on the
scope stack.
-  `post_order_walk(FunctionAST){:cpp}`: We pop that stack out of the scope stack

Let's talk about VarDefAST's walk first, after which the walk of PrototypeAST will make more sense. A VarDefAST
basically just contains a variable definition:
- `pre_order_walk(VarDefAST){:cpp}`: We check if a variable named `var{:cpp}` that we want to define has already been
defined or not.
If it has, then we query the location that previously defined `var{:cpp}` via `symbol_to_loc[var]{:cpp}` and `add_error(){:cpp}` both
the previous location and the current `VarDefAST{:cpp}`'s location.
-  `post_order_walk(VarDefAST){:cpp}`: Do nothing.

Since `PrototypeAST{:cpp}`, the definition of a `FunctionAST{:cpp}`, contains a vector of variable declaration, we apply the same
procedure that we have for `VarDefAST{:cpp}` on `PrototypeAST{:cpp}`.

- `pre_order_walk(PrototypeAST){:cpp}` : Same as `pre_order_walk(VarDefAST){:cpp}` for its vector of variable declaration.
- `post_order_walk(PrototypeAST){:cpp}`: Do nothing.
### Result

Yayyy! Now, if we call the scope checking visitor and let it recursively visit down to each function and
consequently to each variable definition, we'll get something like this to the terminal for the following program.

```
# this is a function
fn f(x : f64) {
    # Use `let{:cpp}` keyword
    let x = 0;
    3 + 1;
    x + 2;
    x - 2;
    x = 2;
}

```

## What's next?

That's it from me for now!

Implementing diagnostics for my compiler was really fun. I knew that being able to abstract and reuse code is a
crucial aspect of software engineering, and showcasing this in an actual project is a big deal for me. Different
stages in a compiler needing diagnostics mean that unless I reuse code, repetitive concepts will keep popping up.

There are still features to be desired and to be implemented. One of them is chaining diagnostic locations: figuring
out a clean way to chain together multiple diagnostic would be really helpful for programmers.Another one is
propagating the location info down to LLVM's codegen stage:
this means that we need to somehow conform the `Location{:cpp}` class to LLVM's debugging location info class.
Interested readers can read about the write up [here](https://llvm.org/docs/SourceLevelDebugging.html)

After this quick demonstration, hopefully I have motivated you to now implement features like detecting the *use of
not-yet-defined
variables* and *use of not-yet-defined functions*.

I hope you enjoyed the blog! (And the music recommendations as well—heheh.)
