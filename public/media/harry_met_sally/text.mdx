When Harry Met Sally... is a 1989 American romantic comedy film written by Nora Ephron and directed by Rob Reiner. It stars Billy Crystal as Harry Burns and Meg Ryan as Sally Albright, two people who keep running into each other over the course of twelve years, debating whether men and women can truly be friends without romance getting in the way.

Ooooo, this one is a good one.
